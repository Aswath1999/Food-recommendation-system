Recommendation system 
Most of us would have come across the quote "prevention is better than cure" and there is no better prevention than eating the right types of food. The food recommendation system used the food.com dataset from kaggle which had recipes and user interactions for the recommendation system.
The food recommendation system used another dataset to match the ingredients to medicinal_properties. The food recommendation system used here uses a item to item collobarative filtering system and also user based filtering system.
The food recommendation system uses a hybrid approach to ensure that the user gets the best suggestion
