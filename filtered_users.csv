33188,58224,2004-07-30,5,These are so good!! My family devoured them - it's so easy to make! i agree with ReeLani - it is very addicting to sample while it's cooking! i did add 4 cloves of garlic (we love garlic)and some minced onion (on the side) - will definitely make again and again! Thanks!
33443,58224,2004-03-21,5,"This was easy, delicious, and extremely versatile. I can see endless options with this baby.This time I served it on toasted Kaiser buns. Cayenne amount was just right for me, but I added 2 cloves of garlic but will add more next time (personnal preference). I had a medium cheddar, so that's what i used."
28346,58224,2004-07-11,5,"Yummm!!  I sampled this a few times as it was cooking and didn't think I would find it too fascinating, but once it was done I found myself quickly addicted!  I had mine plain on a plate with no starches, but a good crusty roll would have been an excellent accompaniment.  I'll be sharing some of this with my mom, and I know she'll share my opinion.  "
115053,58224,2004-08-18,4,"This was great.  I halved the recipe for just my bf and I, he loved it.  Don't all guys love beef?  I added a little more cayenne and half a yellow onion while browning the meat.  We ate this on low-fat wheat buns. Lots of leftovers! Delicious!  Definitely a summer must have!"
101823,58224,2004-09-25,4,"This was a cheesy twist on sloppy joes.  It made a very easy week-night dinner served on toasted buns with oven fries, cottage cheese, and sliced tomatoes.  I added diced onion as I browned the beef and used Lawry's seasoned salt instead of regular.  My hubby ate some of the leftovers with tortilla chips as a hot-hamburger dip.  "
42720,58224,2005-05-29,5,"Boy was this a treat!  Bye bye, sloppy joes - hello ""immoral"" loose meat!! My dh and son and I all loved this stuff.  Okay, I have to confess I added some chopped onion while browning the meat.  I can't help it, I just love onion.  If anyone is leery of trying this because of the beer - don't be! You will be surprised at the wonderful flavor it imparts as it cooks away.  I served this open-faced on toasted hamburger buns.  Great easy meal for busy weeknights or anytime.
"
60992,58224,2005-06-03,4,"A confession, I liked this much better luke warm....on a toasted bun it reminded me of a meatloaf sandwich. I followed directions to the ""T"" and it took approximately 1 hour to cook down. It made a great weeknight dinner with chips and dip and slaw. And I liked it because it made enough to freeze half for future use."
114681,58224,2006-04-10,4,"My daughters boyfriend is from Iowa and loves ""Maidrites"" but this wasn't exactly what I remebered.  I combined then a couple of recipe's as when I first tasted the hamburg mixture I knew it wasn't right.  Omitted this recipe sugar and added 3/4 cup of brown sugar, 1 can of sloppy joe mix, dark beer,and used veveeta instead of american cheese.  Turned out great, a little on the sweeter side.    "
196198,58224,2006-09-18,2,These were a little close to what I grew up eating Maid-Rites in my hometown in Ohio.  The Maid-Rite restaurant opened in the 1940's.  Rumor has it that the ground beef is steamed in beer.  What I don't like about these is the garlic in them.  
130219,58224,2006-10-03,4,"I used to drive 2 hours to Ohio to get these loose meat hamburgers called Maid Rite. Now I can make them any time I want. These are GREAT! The only change I made was adding some fine diced onion to my hamburger as it fried and cut the recipe by 1/3 since I only had 1 pound of hamburger. This made enough for 5 hamburgers for us. Thanks for posting this one, I will be making often. Served with chips and cold beer. Yum, yum, yum."
134011,58224,2006-12-09,5,This recipe ROCKS!!!  Yum-oh!  The kids loved it as is...the big kids loved it with a splash of peri-peri hot sauce over the top.  Cheers ThatBobbieGirl!  Thanks for sharing
86635,58224,2007-01-21,5,"Being from Alabama, I had never heard of these. They truly are awesome. So easy! I can't say if they are true to the midwest way of making, but they are a new favorite here in Birmingham. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!!"
524427,58224,2007-06-25,5,"I liked this so much I registered just so I could comment on it. I wanted to have cheeseburgers tonight, but I didn't want to have the mess that goes with them. This recipe was perfect, and the seasonings are just right. Would give it 10 stars if I could!"
424672,58224,2007-07-13,2,"My fiance, who is not hard to please, said, ""um, its not that great."" We were both kind of grossed out by the creamy liquid that accompanied it, but we ate it anyway. I was very thankful that I sauteed some onion separately and then added it to the mixture. And thank God I had some pickles on hand, because at my first bite, it was very obvious that they were missing from the equation."
313939,58224,2007-07-21,5,"Very Very good!  I had to add onions of course, The only other changes I made was a little smoked paprika for color and smokey flavor, and pre-shredded cheese because I'm a caterer, and like to take any short cuts possible.  But the changes were good, and I think the recipe would be excellent without them also.  I've moved it to my ""Stuff we like"" cookbook.  Thanks TBG for another keeper!"
44642,58224,2007-07-27,1,"Sorry...We just did not care for this. I did add a onion and hot pepper flakes. But has my Dh said this taste as weird as it looks.
But he ate it LOL.But that is the fun of cooking, trying something new.I did cut the recipe to 6serv.
And some times that does not work.
thanks,Bobbie Girl"
1132039,58224,2010-08-11,4,"This was great!  I didn't have venison burger, but I had stew meat, so I used that.  I added an onion as well and saut√©ed it with the garlic before browning the meat.  I used a Guinness extra stout and it turned out wonderful!  Kind of like a Cottage Pie since I served it over roughly mashed yukon gold potatoes.  When most of the liquid had evaporated I added a tablespoon of flour and made a gravy.  I added sharp cheddar, but it didn't make much of a difference for my dish.  It was mainly the Guinness that gave it flavor.  I love the flexibility of this recipe!  I'll definitely be making it again!"
96177,58224,2011-05-02,5,"OUt of this world!!! So much better than the typical burger. We had friends over for dinner last night. Three decided on a grilled burger and two of us chose the ""Immoral Burger"". Guess what we fed to the cats? Yep.. the grilled burgers. Thanks for sharing a super recipe. They are great served with dill pickle and chopped onion and most certainly on a nice soft white bun."
101432,58224,2012-09-14,5,"This was really a very nice change from plain burgers! I had only 3/4 lb of beef to use up, and I was able to cut the recipe down perfectly.  I used brown mustard (all I had) and just a small squirt of ketchup (for my hubby's taste), but everything else was to the letter.  I steamed a couple hoagie buns on top of the meat and topped our big sandwiches with American cheese and dill pickles.  It was WONDERFUL!  Thanks for a great recipe!"
37779,58224,2015-02-21,0,"Delicious sandwich. Salt and pepper amounts used--2 t. salt, 1 t. coarse black pepper. Served on lightly toasted buns spread w/ yellow mustard and added dill pickles slices on top. I love the cheese slices melted into the ground beef. A quick and easy supper for us. Thanks for sharing."
2000498330,58224,2016-04-26,5,Wonderful tangy sloppy sandwich.
80353,93958,2006-05-31,5,"I used only all-purpose flour for this recipe and, because sorghum is unavailable, here, subbed molasses instead, which worked out fine, although it may have made the muffin a bit darker in appearance.  The muffins were very nicely-flavoured - the spice /cocoa/citrus combo coming out well.  Good rise, and tender crumb.  Excellent accompaniment to a cup of hot coffee!"
141898,49262,2006-04-16,5,This was the first time I've made hollandaise sauce and it turned out great! I put a heatproof glass bowl over a pot of simmering/boiling water since I do not have a double boiler per-say. Everyone loved it! I will definatly make this again.
13506,49262,2008-11-12,5,"Oh ... My ... God.   Where did you get my Grandmother's recipe?!?    LOL.  Thank god for those who still know what a double boiler is for!! 

Can I give this one 10 stars?  Please?!?"
1387163,49262,2009-10-15,3,"I used this recipe in a pinch when I realized I didn't have enough hollandaise. It was good, but I thought it fell short of the real deal. I mixed it with the other hollaindaise I had and it worked out well. Thank you for helping save dinner!LOL"
1595919,49262,2010-04-11,1,"Forget it.  Go with the recipe in Joy of Cooking.  Same ingredients, a bit more work but well worth it.  I found this recipe very disappointing."
281701,152261,2006-08-12,5,"Wow!! You're missing out if you haven't tried this amazing smoothie!!  The flavors of the lime, mango and strawberries is just AWESOME!!  Just perfect for those hot summer days!!!"
185625,107699,2005-01-06,4,my mother used to call this gypsy toast 
254614,474769,2012-02-23,3,This was a nice dish to use up potatoes and make gnocchi. I was confused by the instruction of do not let the eggs cook and wisk until a sauce is created. The only way I could wisk with the spinach in it was to remove the gnocchi. Then put it back before serving. I am sure you will get <br/>more ratings from cooks who love goat cheese. Good luck on the contest!
86318,137434,2006-04-09,4,"This is good - I did substitute regular yogurt for the soy yogurt. My main problem with this is that everything is boiled, not sauteed. I can understand the reason for using no oil, but to me it seems detract from the finished curry. JMO Thank you for an interesting idea. It is a very quick and easy curry.  "
69712,53402,2003-06-04,4,"This definitely is a great lasagne, but seriously, DON'T use as much salt as the recipe calls for.  1/2 tsp. for the whole batch should be enough.  "
68812,53402,2004-01-08,5,"Yum, Yum, Yum!  This was terrific. We added extra garlic, used turkey sausage and ground beef, total of 1 tsp salt, added extra sauce (1 jar of Organic spaghetti sauce) This also freezes well. Great recipe-Thanks
"
183094,53402,2007-03-16,5,"My husband is a very picky eater, but he loves this lasagna! I have used both ground turkey and ground beef and it's great either way. It's fairly simple to make and chances are, you won't have to worry about finding a place for leftovers. It definitely is ""killer."""
856953,53402,2008-06-08,0,"This lasagne is really ""Killer""! My son told me this was the best lasagne he has ever eaten! What a compliment... especially from him :-) The only change I made was the addition of pepperoni slices. The dish turned out excellent! It WILL be made again in this household!"
868654,53402,2009-03-06,5,"I used ground beef and pepperoni and it was great!  Make sure you let the lasagna set for about 15 minutes after taking out of the oven, so it comes out in pieces rather than sliding out onto your plate in a glob!"
98590,22526,2004-11-24,5,I made these a while back for a fellowship meeting at church and forgot to rate them. They were really good and easy. Everybody loved them. Thanks for sharing.
124504,22526,2004-12-18,5,I printed this recipe several weeks ago and had not tried it. This morning I got up to the smell of baking to find hubby had found the recipe and made it as a surprise.I worked till midnight so i never even saw it. What a great surprise and boy is it delicious!!!! 
76951,22526,2004-12-25,5,Fantastic!  And couldn't be easier.  A big hit at my house.
50425,22526,2002-07-28,5,"So EASY!  Big hit with the kids!  I'm sure they ate more then their fair share!  I have found this recipe in several different sites with the only difference being the amount of cinnamon used.  I see amounts ranging from 2 teaspoons to 2 tablespoons (unless it's a typo!)  I used a little over one tablespoon judging by just what looked like ""enough"".  It was very good that way!  Only problem I found was ""cutting"" it into slices so we just pulled it apart and ate it!  Very Yummy!  A great thing to do on the Eve of something like Christmas when you don't want to get up and fix breakfast the next morning.  Good for making while on a vacation with a kitchen as not much is needed for a great home cooked breakfast treat!"
29212,22526,2002-07-29,0,"Killian, I should have mentioned in the recipe that you just pull it apart.  Glad you enjoyed it so much."
20480,22526,2002-07-30,5,VERY GOOD! We really enjoyed it.Thanks
46545,22526,2002-08-02,5,"I LOVE waking up and just popping this in the oven!  And it tastes great, too. (can't go wrong with cinnamon)  Thankyou for our new holiday breakfast."
56118,22526,2002-09-26,5,Thank you for such an easy delicious breakfast for company.  Everyone thinks I spend a lot of time preparing this!  I make this everytime we have overnight guests.  My four year old loves to wake up and smell them baking.  I use the full amount of cinnamon and occasionally add some pecans or walnuts.  One nice thing about this recipe is that it is easy to keep all the ingredients on hand.  
38024,22526,2002-12-22,5,"I love that these can be put together at night and just popped in the oven in the morning. I made these with frozen egg twist rolls (Kineret Chall-ettes) which made these even richer.  However, they must be larger than the frozen rolls referred to in the original recipe.  I put 16 rolls in a bundt pan, and they rose considerably higher than the pan.  They were still delicious, but not so pretty.  Next time, I'll make them with just 8 rolls and they should be gorgeous as well as tasty."
59780,22526,2003-04-08,5,"Awesome Recipe! My friend gave this recipe to me as well and it is the easiest thing to make! I make my homemade buns recipe#58660 and when I reach the step of forming them into buns, I roll these into golf ball size rolls and freeze them in a single layer on a cookie sheet. When they are fully frozen I place them into a container and I'm all set to whip up a fancy morning breakfast! I really enjoyed the smell of these as they baked in the oven and my family, including our exchange student who doesn't like a lot of bread, gobbled up this when I made it for breakfst last week. My husband even put in a request to have it every Sunday! Thanks for posting!"
90799,22526,2003-06-24,5,"This was the most simple, delicious recipe I think i've ever found. I use to make homemade cinnamon rolls and my family would beg for them, I cooked this recipe when they were all over and the taste was so much the same i'll never go to all the trouble of making the other recipe again! It's land of nod for me from now on!! Thank you for your recipe"
113117,22526,2003-11-25,5,"These were great.  I added more brown sugar, cinnamon and pudding.  I also used walnuts instead of raisins.  I will be making these often.  I would also suggest placing the bundt pan on a pizza pan or aluminum foil to catch any overflow."
35848,22526,2003-11-30,5,"Yum!  I love make ahead recipes - followed this one exactly with great results.  Easy, and so delicious hot out of the oven.  I left the leftovers out after breakfast and everyone broke off a piece every time they walked by the kitchen counter!"
112880,22526,2003-12-14,5,"Great recipe!  I'm not reall gung-ho about cinnamon, so I just used 1/2 tbsp and they were great!  Also used pecans instead of raisins.  However, after only 20 minutes of cooking, mine were already burning on top.  Fortunately, I like mine a little well done.  "
107014,22526,2004-01-20,5,Absolutely delicious and SOOOOOOO easy!  Can't get any better than that!!!
125219,22526,2004-02-08,5,"This was as easy as advertised. It is better than most store bought cinnamin rolls, and a snap to make. The warm freshness makes it especially good. You can also add pecans to the mix. Certainly not lo cal or lo carb, but delicious."
79900,22526,2004-04-18,5,I can't believe how easy this was.  It was delicious!  My husband was a bit skeptical when he saw me making it but loved it while he was eating it!!!  I will definitely be making this again (perhaps tomorrow!) because it was so easy to put together and very YUMMY!!!
51272,22526,2004-04-29,5,"Yum, Yum, I made these  with diet vanilla pudding and brown diet sugar twin. My husband loved them even though they were made with the diet ingredients. Will make many more times. I also used my own roll dough."
135511,22526,2004-05-13,2,"Unfortunately this just wasn't a hit with us.  We found the buns too ""sickly sweet"" with altogether too much of the topping on them that we were all picking it off to eat it.  After it cools I found that the topping takes on a very sticky texture that is like taffy sticking to your teeth.  It was extremely easy to make however.  It was worth the try. "
116401,22526,2004-05-25,5,"Excellent!Prepared as directed. I did use pecan halves around one half of a cup and no raisins. I also mixed up a powdered sugar icing using one cup powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons milk and drizzled that over the top of the rolls once I had inverted them onto a plate. Just great, a hit!thnks, PeggyLynn"
134686,22526,2004-05-28,5,"Isn't this a wonderful recipe?  My version uses a 3 oz box of instant butterscotch pudding instead of vanilla pudding, and pecans but not raisins.  To avoid bad language, I prepare it in an angel food cake pan instead of a bundt pan.  Thanks for sharing, Bert."
29063,22526,2004-06-15,5,"Delicious! Made with sugar free pudding and it was wonderful. Enjoyed by everybody, especially me for it's ease - when you have guests and the house is busy it's a snap to do!"
101034,22526,2004-07-03,5,These were so good. I used sugar free pudding and made them in an angel food cake pan. They turned out perfect and so delicious. Thanks Bert
31331,22526,2004-11-21,5,"I first made this last year for Thanksgiving day breakfast.  Sorry that I forgot to review it then, because I have made it several times since!!  Not only did I forget to review it, I forgot to add it to my cookbook!  I'm feeling very blonde!  Had to ask for it in Request A Recipe! It is simply awesome, and oh so easy to do!  The kids just LOVE it!  It will become a holiday tradition in our house!"
163241,22526,2004-12-25,5,"Well, here it is Christmas morning.  I took your advice and put this incredible dessert together last night at midnight.  We all opened our presents today and then I popped it into the oven.  As they are cooking, obviously the house smelled like heaven on earth.  However, my two sons and husband were all tired and kept saying ""we're not hungry!"".  So, out comes the rolls, and I invert them onto a beautiful platter. I put on the saddes puppy dog face I could muster and said, ""I went through all this trouble (lol) to make this and no one will even try it - sniff, sniff.""  So, they said, ""okay, give us a piece.""  Guess what, in about 15 minutes the WHOLE ENTIRE PLATE WAS GONE! They went absolutely crazy.  They said it was the best thing they had ever tasted!  Thank you, thank you for giving me a wonderful recipe. You also gave me a wonderful, funny memory of my tired and cranky boys saying they weren't hungry and then eating the rolls like ravenous lions...lol!  Merry Christmas.

tree luee dee"
176615,22526,2004-12-25,5,"I made these for Christmas morning and the whole pan was gone before lunch. I used a whole stick of butter, left off the raisins, and baked in a tube pan. They were very sweet and rich and enjoyed by all, even me, and I do not usually care for frozen bread dough. Besides being very tasty, these get 5 stars for being pathetically easy and so convenient on a very chaotic Christmas morning. Thanks so much, bert!"
32058,22526,2004-12-29,5,"Everyone wanted the recipe, making again for New Years Brunch!  TY"
27798,22526,2005-01-08,5,Mmmmmm. We loved this. I have made it twice this week. The first time we thought it had just a little bit too much cinnamon glaze on it so when I made it the second time I cut the glaze in half. I think that just a little more than half would be perfect. Thanks so much for a new and really easy breakfast idea! 
185142,22526,2005-01-28,5,"Extremely easy. The taste is sinful and my house smelled amazing. I couldn't find frozen rolls, so I bought 2 1 lb. loaves of frozen bread dough and cut them up. It worked beautifully. Yum! Yum!
(You can cut this recipe in half and bake for 20 min. in a loaf pan)."
122689,22526,2005-01-29,4,my children enjoyed this.The cinnamon sugar mixture was a little hard in places when I served it!! will make this again.
92913,22526,2005-10-05,5,This was so yummy! Easy to prepare. My whole family loved them. I followed the recipe exactly except I forgot to grease the pan and they were a little stuck. We just pulled them apart to eat. Thanks so much!
119466,22526,2005-12-26,5,"I have put these together the past two years on Christmas Eve to bake on Christmas morning. We like that morning to be a relaxing one, and I don't relish the idea of a lot of time spent in the kitchen. They are quite delicious, especially considering the minimal effort involved. Although I normally prefer making my own bread dough, I have no problem using frozen rolls in this situation and think it is fabulous to get up Christmas morning, preheat the oven, and shortly have the smell of cinnamon permeating our home while opening gifts. I do skip the raisins. Thanks for posting the recipe!"
210117,22526,2006-01-18,5,"These pull-apart cinnamon buns are mouth watering! Easy to make, fun to eat!  Tastes like you spent hours raising the dough, etc."
333017,22526,2006-07-22,5,"I have always done this buns for Xmas.  But like everything else I do, I change the recipe.  Since I never have vanilla pudding in the house, that is gone and I do cut the butter down to 1/4 cup.  I have, in the past, made up my own buns...froze them, then used them in this recipe.  I love  the fact that the recipe can be done the night before, so you are stress free in the morning!!"
67103,22526,2006-09-16,3,"I have three boys and none of them liked the rolls.  My husband and I thought they tasted pretty good, but not great.  They smelled great while baking and were beautiful when I inverted them on the plate, so I am a little disappointed.  Around the edges were especially dry with not much of the sauce on them and tasted like just plain dinner rolls.  I will probably not make this recipe again, but it was definitely worth the try.  Thanks, Bert.  I'm sorry I couldn't give it a better rating.  It just didn't work well for our family."
272434,22526,2006-11-08,3,"These were pretty good. They could have been better if the rolls were cut up into small pieces instead of left whole.  All in all, they were decent.  Probably won't make again though. "
57081,22526,2006-12-21,4,"This has become a favourite, on Christmas morning, when the grandparents come for breakfast. I use an angel food pan as well. I use a lipped cookie pan to catch the sugar/butter mixture, and to bake on so it doesn't drip in the oven as well. It grows in the oven too, so I use the lowest rack. Easy to make after wrapping the last present."
345899,22526,2007-01-26,4,"This recipe was great, my kids loved it. I added a bit too much of the vanilla pudding mix and it did make the brown sugar not melt into as much of a gooey syrup, but it didn't ruin it by any means. Stick to the exact measurements and you'll have better than bakery rolls."
165263,22526,2007-03-02,4,Very good.  I think I will cut my rolls in half next time so more of the bread is covered in goo. Great tasting topping!
313120,22526,2007-03-19,5,This recipe was great and so easy.  Thanks will be making this again.
76554,22526,2007-07-16,5,"So very easy and soooo delicious! Ok, they will not compare to let's say Cinnabon or Cinzano but for something quick and easy you can't do better.

I followed the recipe to a T using 2 Tbsp of cinnamon and 1/2 cup of butter. I left out the raisins because no one here likes them.

The only thing I did a little different is that I cut the buns in two so that more pieces had flavoring on them.

Definite keeper for us! We will make these again soon."
174121,22526,2007-11-20,5,I've made this several times and it's always wonderful.
461917,22526,2007-12-23,4,"Very good and easiest cinn. bun recipe I ever made!
If you need them that day, just heat oven to 220 degrees for 10 mins, turn oven off and let the rolls rise in that warmed oven..they rise in about an hour. Then bake as directed.
Thanks for easy recipe!"
7798,22526,2007-12-31,5,"We loved this recipe. I have made it on the past two Christmas Eve's -- sooo easy and so good on Christmas morning when we are opening our gifts with our family. Thank you very much for posting it. I made pudding with the pudding mix I had left over from making this, I just used a little less milk than the recipe on the box of pudding called for."
389431,22526,2008-08-04,5,"This is amazing!
We had 6 overnight guests and I was fretting over what to make for breakfast... stumbled across this recipe and figured it was worth a shot. It was cheap, easy and something I wouldn't have to get up too early to do!
I used all 24 dinner rolls (Bridgefort is the only brand I could find), the whole box of instant pudding mix, 1 TB of cinnamon and then omitted the raisins (there were 4 kids)... 
Let it rise overnight and panicked in the morning when the rolls were coming over the top of the bundt pan!  I pushed them back in and baked as stated...
25 min later, a BEAUTIFUL breakfast was ready for my still sleepy guests...
I served this with fresh bananas and apples... and EVERYONE cleaned their plates!
My DH even remarked that this rivaled his mothers family famous cinnamon rolls that she is requested to  make for every holiday and family function!  
I LOVE this recipe and will be using it often!  Thank you so much!!"
129238,22526,2008-08-16,5,"I have made this several times when I have had overnight guests. It is so easy and tastes so good! I have modified the recipe using just 12 wholewheat frozen dough rolls, 1 tbsp cinnamon, half a stick of butter and 1/2 cup of walnuts or pecans instead of raisins. The rest is the same. I make it in a bundt pan and bake it for 20 mins."
1023906,22526,2008-11-13,5,"Yummy!  I have always wanted to make cinnamon buns and yesterday I finally did it!  Had a group of gals over and everybody raved about them.  Just wish I had sprayed the pan more, but they were wonderful."
1175036,22526,2009-10-12,5,"I had a craving for cinnamon rolls, but did not want to make the effort to roll out dough.  These satisfied my craving and they were wonderful.  I've already recommended them to many people."
218535,22526,2010-10-05,4,This is very good but I thought Pull Apart Monkey Bread Recipe #28980 is better.
1974537,22526,2011-08-18,5,LOVE these!  I had lost the recipe and haven't made them for years and missed them on Christmas mornings!  So easy and so good.  I omit the raisins just for personal preference.  I am so thrilled to have it back in my life:)
2002010667,22526,2018-02-24,0,I also use a loaf of frozen bread dough sliced into 16 pieces instead of the rolls sometimes. Works just as well :)
186979,333797,2009-03-03,5,"I remember, vividly, eating gallons and gallons of this soup as a child growing up on the prairies of Minnesota. But, nothing was written down in those farm kitchens so I lost the original recipe. Thanks to Molly, I found her's posted on a forum and prayed it was the same: it is! Absolutely simple and budget conscious, it still delivers a whollup of a taste! I only used 2 quarts of water (we like it thick) and used marjoram instead of ginger (as grandma would have). Let it cook 2 hours, blended it, and then threw in smoked ham and let it simmer another hour. This soup with a spoon of yogurt on top and crusty rye rolls is perfect for any cold, brisk Winter day."
209255,161370,2006-02-22,3,"The rub on this chicken was great.  The topping, however, did nothing for us.  We used green peppers that weren't overly strong in flavour and they still seemed to overpower the flavour of the topping.  We will use the rub again on its own."
169969,161370,2006-02-25,5,We were expecting a chicken with more of a jerk heat but were not disappointed. We like our jerked chicken with skin so I did not use boneless skinless chicken. The topping was very good and I would suggest doubling it!!! yummy!!! Good luck Chef!
128473,161370,2006-02-26,3,"The chicken turned out plump, moist, tender and a little bit bland. The sauce was nice but definitely needed the habanero pepper. The next time that I make this dish I will marinate the chicken for 1 - 2 days instead of 6 hours, I will also leave the bones and skin on and double all of the spices."
129201,161370,2006-02-27,5,Delicious!!  Made to the recipe apart from cutting my chicken into largish chunks. Great flavour and easy to prepare - this was a hit with the family. My only problem with the recipe is that you didn't state a temperature for the oven - I baked at 180C for about 40 minutes. Thanks for a great meal and good luck!!!
66008,161370,2006-03-02,4,This was good though it did have a bite to it. The recipe does not state the cooking temperature.
293901,161370,2006-03-06,4,"I don't think I've ever eaten chicken breasts that were as tender as these.  The rub is wonderful, though a little too hot for our taste and that is the only reason this didn't get 5 stars.  So easy to prep and the topping went together in a snap.  I shall make this again with maybe 1/2 of the amount of cayenne, chili amd black peppers. The aroma is lovely and the flavor combo quite good."
219942,161370,2006-03-07,5,"We loved this chicken, even the picky daughter. The jerk rub did just as you said and filled the house with lovely smells! For the topping I used 3 cloves of garlic, (we love garlic!), and 1 jalapeno. I didn't need to let the sauce thicken on the stove. It thickened nicely in the oven. The chicken baked for 45 minutes, (the chicken breasts were large), and came out moist and perfectly cooked. I will be making up a quantity of the jerk rub for future use! Great recipe! "
82616,161370,2006-03-11,5,Ok last night I decided I wanted chicken so I came to zaar to seek out one of the RSC recipes and I found a true winner. I did not have the habanero pepper but it still tasted nummy!! You cannot believe the wonderful smell that fills the house. Why have plain chicken again. The list of ingredients seems intimidating but it really not a huge task to add. Someone really put their thinking caps on for this one. I love it !!!
135269,161370,2006-03-12,5,"This recipe is now the fav chicken dish in our house. My husband was very tired of the same old, so I decided to try something new. I only let the rub mix set for one hour, but next time I will let it sit longer so the flavor is more intence. And I am not a habanero fan, so I split this in two pans, but I ended up helping my husband and son eat their share. I hope to see more recipes like this. Thanks"
39835,161370,2006-03-13,4,"Good and spicy (and I left out the habanero pepper). Next time I'll go a bit easier on the hot spices, but we still enjoyed it and the topping was great over rice. Thanks for sharing and good luck!"
64154,161370,2006-03-19,3,"I made two versions of this.
1) Used skinned leg quarters, Ancho chilli powder and dried thyme leaves.
2) Used bonless chicken braests, regular chilli powder, ground thyme and no cayenne.
The recipe did not say what temp. to bake it at. I started at 325, after 30 minutes it did not seem to be cooking well. I increase the temp to 350 and baked for 45 minutes more. 
The breast (#2) was very strong on thyme. The leg quarters (#1) was ok on thyme, but lacked spicyness that the cayenne should of given it.
Over all both versions lacked something. Perhaps a healthy dose of garlic powder. A good basic recipe with potential.  "
57222,161370,2006-03-22,4,"Wowzer, what a perfectly hot meal! Keeps your mouth warm but doesn't burn. I used 3 chicken breasts as that's what I had, marinated overnight, and instead of habanero pepper used 1/2 orange chile pepper for the topping (again, because that's what I had!). The topping was slightly sweet and complemented the spicy chicken so well. Next time I'll add a bit of salt to the chicken. Oven temperature was not stated; baked at 200 C for 35 minutes. Made for a lovely meal which was light to boot! Thanks! :-)"
182010,161370,2006-03-23,5,Excellent dish.  The chicken is tender and not overly spiced (though I did omit the optional chile).  The topping is wonderfully rich and really makes the dish!
179133,161370,2006-08-14,5,"This was very tasty and very spicy! I had to replace chives with parsley and habanero with pickled jalapeno (couldn't get them). Also used chicken thighs instead of breasts. Recipe didn't give a temp. to bake at so I did at 375√Ç¬∞F for 35 minutes. Chicken was nice and moist. Loved the flavors from the seasoning mix. Thanks and good luck in the contest! - Mar 5, 2006 Update: I had some of this in the freezer and wanted to do something a little different with it. I thawed out a serving (a couple thighs worth) and then mixed it with a pkg of cream cheese, a couple Tbsp mayo and 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese to make an excellent chicken salad! Thanks again Pamela!"
318236,161370,2006-09-17,4,"This is great!  I cut my chicken breasts up into a few pieces, which reduced my cooking time.  I also cut down on the chilli and pepper as I don't like my food too hot. "
353708,161370,2006-10-02,3,"I made this recipe this weekend for my family and they did not care for it.  I have been to Jamaica and it didn't taste like the jerk chicken that they have there.  It was too thyme, too tomatoey and not enough jerk taste.  My husband said it tasted like I poured a hot salsa over top of the chicken and baked it.  The jerk chicken in Jamaica is more like a barbecue sauce on the chicken.  If I make it again, I would tweak the recipe for more jerk flavor."
329638,161370,2007-09-02,5,"Very very good! I mixed the spices together and added it to a bag of skineless chicken legs and thighs, and froze it for several weeks.  I pulled it out of the freezer last nigth to thaw in the fridge.  I mixed up the topping just before baking, and added an additional teaspoon of brown sugar to the topping to sweeten it up a little more for my family's liking, and a few dashes of hot pepper sauce in place of the habenero.  I only added the topping to half the chicken (due to the kids).  It baked up so fantastically- the chicken without the topping were flavorful but not too spicy, the ones with the topping were so flavorful and delicious.  What a great recipe- thanks for posting!"
331557,161370,2007-11-23,5,I really liked the flavour in this.  As we can't handle things too hot I cut the cayenne into a 1/4 teaspoon and omitted the habanero pepper and it was perfect.  Lightly spiced without burning the mouth.  We really enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing!
722187,161370,2008-01-09,5,It was wonderful spicewise but we used half a cup of serranos for our peppers and it was way too hot - and we know spicey! I will use the serranos again next time but probably a 1/4 cup of them so I can enjoy the other spices.
213139,161370,2008-03-22,5,"This was very good, served it over rice.  I used an unseeded jalapeno instead of the habenero and it was plenty spicy!  Leftover chicken will go into a soup for dinner on Monday night which is something that I do often when we have leftover chicken.  Reviewed for Healthy Choices 2008 ABC Tag Game."
140132,161370,2009-10-03,5,"I made this tonight for supper and we loved it.  The chicken was moist and juicy with the lovely vegetable mixture on top.  I served this with rice and peas and glazed carrots.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us, its a keeper."
1271914,161370,2009-11-11,1,I expected it to taste like something Jamaican and it really didn't to me. It was not at all  what I expected and it may have been better without the crushed tomatoes.
1008996,161370,2011-02-02,3,"I was a little disappointed with this recipe because it didn't taste very Jamaican, but it wasn't terrible.  The spices and the vegetables were looking very good, until I added the crushed tomatoes.  It seemed like there were too many and I didn't feel like this recipe was much different than putting tomato sauce on top of chicken and baking it.  If I made this again, I would double the spices, or cut the crushed tomatoes in half.  We left out the habenero and the cayenne, because my family does not like spicy stuff.  It may have tasted better with the spicy ingredients, but I think the recipe needs to hold it's own without the spice.  Thanks anyway, it was fun to try!"
2217504,161370,2014-01-29,5,"This is dish creates the most amazing aroma in the kitchen while it&#039;s baking, and then the most amazing flavors explode in your mouth while eating it. I love serving this over rice and a side salad.  Such a different flavor experience. I usually try not to step too far out of my comfort zone with recipes, but I took a chance on this one and it&#039;s now one of our absolute favorites."
198228,42570,2005-04-13,5,"The marinade on this is delicious.  I didn't cut up the chicken, just grilled breast halves, and we had it for our main course.  This was wonderful!"
51011,42570,2008-02-18,5,"I threw these together yesterday.  My dh has been on a lowfat diet kick for a couple of months now, and I wanted to throw something new into the mix.  I didn't marinade overnight because I didn't want it to be too overwhelming.  I also added bell pepper, and onion slices to my kabobs, and made zucchini and mushroom kabobs as well.  Ended up basting everything with extra marinade before cooking.  YUM! It was very tasty and good.  Perfect dinner for a chilly night.  Thanks for sharing."
527823,200148,2007-06-30,3,Actually the kids LOVED this because it was like pudding  :P
929450,200148,2008-09-29,0,Actually to get the cheesecake consistency you need to use at least FIRM silken tofu.  Soft will get you.. well pudding.
137302,428056,2010-06-07,4,This soup was pretty good.  I think it needed something else...but wasn't sure what.  Made for ZWT #6 -2010
2710499,310570,2013-02-25,5,great recipe - very much like the real thing from back home in Montenegro!
663997,197013,2017-02-18,5,Delicious and easy.
563669,310570,2009-05-05,4,I have been looking for a cheese burek (or burek sa sir) recipe since I visited Bosnia and fell in love with them.  Thank you so much for posting this-- it sounds exactly like I remember and I cannot wait to try it!
1593428,310570,2011-07-01,5,this was so yummy and not to difficult to make. thanks for a great recipe!
2000743062,310570,2016-11-12,4,"Very nice recipe, but missing a few things for me. It needs a pinch of allspice in my opinion, a hint of paprika and a small squeeze of lemon. And, of course, spinach. To me Bosnian cheese B&ouml;rek is always with spinach. Just makes it so much better"
85873,103948,2005-03-09,5,"Great recipe. Family liked the 2 meats together.I used the slow oven method. Thanks MarieAlice, I will be making this again."
86318,103948,2005-05-08,4,"This was good, but somehow was not something I'd like to try again. It seemed like a nice idea, but I think I prefer beef and chicken separate. Sorry to sound like a picky child, but I guess we are all different. Thank you for the interesting experience."
1590702,103948,2011-04-12,0,"My husband was thrilled! His mother used to make something like this on special occasions and this gave him a taste of his childhood.  Easy to make, a little time consuming, but well worth it. Delicious, absolutely delicious!!"
178427,495314,2013-03-02,5,Another great sauce for ribs! All the flavors blended nicely together and it was a snap to make. I used it as a mop sauce on grilled baby back ribs. Thanks for sharing and Good Luck in the contest.
22642,59534,2005-04-08,5,"Okay first all my substitutions: Halved the recipe for Hubby and me, used 6 button mushrooms sliced and sauted with the onion and garlic instead of canned mushrooms, used 8 ounces tri-coloured twisty pasta instead of cappelletti or elbow macaroni (I've only ever seen straight macaroni here), half a can of weight watcher's tomato soup, and I used half of a 200g can of chopped tomatoes. This is a very nice, filling dish - there wasn't a need for bread on the side for us! I baked it in an 8x8inch pan since I don't have a 3 qt casserole dish. The cheese wasn't too thick which was nice. The sweetness of the corn pairs nicely with the acidicity of the canned tomatoes. "
22788,59534,2005-04-15,5,"I have a mazetti recipe of my own but decided to try this one as it called for different ingredients than mine. This recipe was VERY GOOD, but I still prefer my own which is posted here on recipe*zarr along with another chef's version. I will keep this recipe in my recipe box as hubby likes this one as well as mine.....and it will be nice to have a different flavor in mazetti once in awhile. I prepared this as written but did use the tri-colored pasta as I thought the picture was so pretty and yummy looking."
182081,59534,2005-06-21,5,"I'm giving this a five not because it is gourmet cuisine or anything, but because my pantry has a lot more space now and the results of this dish, as DH put it were ""very addictive"".  I was short on noodles, so I used the noodles from 2 boxes of mac and cheese and it seemed to be the perfect amount!  I WILL be making this again!"
86318,83542,2004-03-26,5,These are pleasingly substantial muffins chock-full of all kinds of good things. Thank you for the recipe. They will add variety to our muffin basket.
65056,83542,2004-10-30,4,"Even *I* like these bran muffins!...But then again, bran muffins are my favorite, so its not really that surprising!  These are a good simple recipe for bran muffins- I like the addition of sunflower and sesame seeds.  The sesame impart a lovely sesame flavor.  The flavor is good and they are just sweet enough.  The one problem I had is that the batter was a bit wet, and, as a result, the muffins turned out a bit...um...loose grained?  They don't really hold together as well nor are they as puffy as other bran muffin recipes I've enjoyed.  I think the quanity of milk could probably be reduced or the amount of oil- I feel that they're a tad oilier than they really need to be.  I made a half recipe since I only have 2 6-cup muffin tins and I didn't really want to make 2 batches.    I did follow the suggestion of the recipe and used 3/4 cup bran, 1/4 cup wheat germ- maybe this had something to be with the cohesion problem?  Anyhow, a good muffin recipe with very nice flavor, but I do think they need a little less liquid."
464253,83542,2007-04-01,5,"These are very moist and delicious. I think the added seeds made it very special-they gave it the muffin a wonderful nutty flavor. They were indeed extremely moist and a tad on the oily side. I used dried apricots instead of raisins because that's what I had on hand and it worked well, I thought. I included the optional wheat germ and used whole wheat flour. They're easy to make and I highly recommend you try them!"
571575,83542,2007-08-27,5,"Excellent recipe.  These are so moist and delicious.  I left out the seseme and sunflower seeds, because I didnt have them, but I am sure they would be great with them too!  I did use 1cup buttermilk and 1cup milk, and I also used the wheat germ...Love them!"
65056,48156,2004-10-12,5,"I am just begining to learn a bit about Ayurveda, and I don't really feel like I can comment on the 'emotional balancing' effects of this.  But I can tell you, it tastes great!  I used it in Coconut Rice (Nasi Lemak)  #69488 (which calls for a similar spice mixture) and it was terrific.  I have also added it to some sauteed veggies, and it is also very nice.  Rich flavors, not too spicy and just plain tasty.  I have to say, I did not add the black cumin, but I can see how that would be a nice addition.  Thanks for posting, Mini!  I'm glad I have a nice jar of this in the cupboard for future use.  "
191739,48156,2008-03-02,5,This is the fourth or fifth time that I have made a double batch of this recipe! I use the black cumin (available at any indian grocery) and it helps to create a really intriguing and unique flavor.
844554,48156,2009-03-26,5,This looked very interesting and a good way to use up those herbs in the cabinet. I've mainly used it on veggies and will use again. Thanks.
394592,164526,2008-11-05,5,"So good...so creamy...my ""take"" on it made it sort of a sweet and spicy mix 'cause I used some ""repurposed"" left~over sweet 'tato and some hot peppers from my garden mixed with sweet red pepper and a bit of HAPPY HALLOWEEN ""repurposed pumpky""...my homemade broth and nut butter also have quite a kick to them and I added lots of garlic to further the kicks :) used all the celery and onion... & then some ((it melts away into the creamy dreaminess delightfully))...for me no need to puree the mix (( it was so velvety all on its own)) & I absolutely adored the addition of apple and NANA - LOVE IT!!! topped my bowls with raw pumpkin seed croutons...super good -thanks Cookgirl"
220348,164526,2009-02-13,5,"This is a fantastic recipe. I never had cashew butter before and I thought it added a fantastic flavour to the soup. Wonderful, just wonderful!"
37779,342620,2014-08-28,5,"We love meatloaf and this one looked interesting. It was delicious. I used a hickory smoked bbq sauce. The meatloaf was tender, held together when sliced and had an incredible smoky flavor. Love the red bell pepper. Thanks for sharing."
311339,33165,2006-04-16,5,"Wow!  This is my new favorite potato salad.  I like that it doesn't have eggs and all their fat and cholesterol.  I omitted the pimentoes and garlic.  I used non-fat yogurt, non-fat sour cream and non-fat mayonnaise.  I substituted apple cider vinegar.  It was soooo fast and easy to prepare.  I'm lazy and I didn't have a problem with this.  It fits right in with my low to no-fat diet.  Thanks. I don't know how I lived without this."
104295,33165,2007-07-07,5,"Best fat free potato salad I've ever had (and I've had a bunch!).  I used all fat free products and it was super creamy and flavorful.  The combination of mayo, sour cream, and yogurt allowed it to not taste like fat free mayo.  I'll make this again."
399552,33165,2008-06-12,5,"I made this for a luncheon for thirty seniors. They-and the kitchen staff- loved it. I used 90 small red potatoes, cut them in quarters and quadrupled the rest of the ingredients. I didn't use pimentos or garlic. It was awesome. Not even a spoonful left!!! I will definately make this again for church functions and for family gatherings. Thanks Carrie Ann-I'll even pass it on to my TOPS friends."
82568,33165,2010-04-09,4,I really like this recipe. I did use light Miracle Whip because we really don't like the taste of fat-free mayo. I also made 1 1/3 batch to make it extra moist. It was good and an excellent alternative to the full fat recipes that try to give you cardiac arrest-) Thanks Carrie Ann for posting this. I Made this a long time ago and forgot to review it. Good alternative for those of us watching our weight.
1217999,33165,2010-06-06,5,Great lowfat/fat free option.  I used fat free sour cream and fat free yogurt- which made the sauce thinner- so I added a few more potatoes.  Wonderful.
20591,43164,2002-10-21,0,"
This is also one of my favorite episotes, I'll try this recipe as soon as I can find some veal!!  I live in a very small town!!Thank You.  I'm so excited to find this."
59064,54272,2003-10-18,5,Excellent vegetarian chilli that everyone enjoyed. I did cut down the chili powder to a heaped tsp for a mild chilli as my toddler was eating this. Went down an absolute treat.
125600,54272,2004-02-10,5,My whole family loved this recipe which happens to include two very serious carnivores.  Plus it's easy to make.  We added 1/2 tsp cumin and oregano for some extra spice.  
165091,54272,2004-09-28,5,This was THE BEST chili I have ever made and/or eaten!  This was the first vegetarian chili I have tried and I certainly could not taste a difference without the real beef.  The only adaptations I made is that I substituted the celery for one chopped green bell pepper because I don't really care for cooked celery.  And what did I get?  The best chili ever!!!!  Definitely will make this again and again.  :-)
67656,54272,2005-01-08,3,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the directions should read 1 1/2 cups of rehydrated TVP, not 1 1/2 cups TVP rehydrated.  I only add a portion of the TVP stated as the chili looked entirely too thick more like a casserole than a chili. The result was also a little bland so I added some extra chili powder and 1 tsp of cumin.  Though the final dish was fine, no one was fooled. will continue to experiment with this recipe as it has great possibilities. "
59064,50184,2003-01-24,5,"WOW! This is a 6 star soup! Anything that has mushrooms and cashews can hardly not taste good but this soup is wonderful.
The cashews puree really easily in the blender so don't let the the nut preparation put you off making this. My toddler went crazy over this soup. This is the first soup she has ever wanted to try and once she had the first taste I couldn't stop her :-D! She ate an adult sized portion, I ate the rest. A friend of mine noted that this is Atkins suitable. It is...but the only problem is that you would never stop at one serving. I've been recommending this soup to all my friends. Great recipe Basia!"
46545,50184,2003-04-04,5,"Wonderful!!!  This soup has a nice mushroom flavor and really is ""creamy!""  I was afraid it would taste too nutty because of all the cashews but was very pleasantly suprised.  So easy to put together, too.  I don't mind the fat content because nuts have some 'good' fats and the extra protein is a big plus.  I used grapeseed oil instead of butter and didn't have any nutmeg, but a little salt and fresh ground pepper topped it off nicely.  Thanks, basai!  "
120301,50184,2004-01-04,5,"This was great.  I was looking for a way to use up a lot of mushrooms that had seen better days.  Yum!  I also had some half'n half, so I made it an even richer creamier soup by substituting half'n half for half of the water.  I also omitted the chile powder since my family doesn't like it.  Thanks for the timely recipe.  It's wonderful!"
335056,50184,2006-08-05,0,"If you take raw cashews and blend them and add half and half to them,  don't cook,  and add sauted mushrooms and onions and eat over spinach noodles.   Is really great.   Salt and pepper and garlic to taste."
331472,50184,2006-12-23,5,"I'll be honest, I had my doubts but this was really lovely and my guests all asked for seconds!  I forgot the chili powder and didn't have any nutmeg.  Came out delish.  Thanks!"
425731,185799,2007-02-06,5,"This is so good that even I like it and I'm not the diabetic. I used the premade crusts since there is very little sugar in there anyway, and it worked great. I will be making this again and again for my guy."
834353,185799,2009-11-17,5,"All I can say is WOW!!  

I made everything as written... right down to the crust and spring form pan... and between the spices, nuts and richness of the ingredients, the sugar free ""taste"" was almost non-existent.  

I had a bit of a time trying to figure out if the cake was cooking correctly as my oven seemed to take longer (and then browned the first layer of the cake) which worried me.... but after the second layer went on and was ""set"" by the increased heat.... and then cooled, everything compacted down into a dense and creamy cake... which is just what I was hoping for.  

I made this for my husband's b-day tonight... and it was a HUGE hit.

I will definitely be making this again!  Thank you for posting!!"
29782,306168,2008-12-31,5,"This was one of the best broccoli casseroles that I have ever made.  I made my own chicken soup for this recipe. I was a bit worried about the tsp of soy sauce but it gave the casserole the best flavor. YUM!  
The photos you took (shapeweaver) inspired me to make this recipe and it actually does look just like them when it comes out of the oven.  
Thanks so much for sharing your recipe shapeweaver. It was wonderful!  Going into my family's favorite Zaar cookbook :)"
1196280,306168,2009-04-13,5,I made this for my son's first birthday party this weekend. Our guests INHALED it! Everyone kept saying how delicious it was. I was I could have gotten to try it.
768828,306168,2013-08-02,5,Loved this.  Be sure to completely thaw the broccoli.  I didn&#039;t and it didn&#039;t get done in time specified.  Just cooked it a little longer though and it was perfect.  Thanks Chef.
520830,306168,2017-10-17,5,"5 stars from my husband and son, my toughest critics. I used a 10-oz bag of chopped broccoli and a 10-oz bag of flowerettes which gave it more texture. Very good flavor and the smell while cooking was great. The sauce held it together without overwhelming the broccoli."
527607,261215,2007-11-03,5,"Terrific cake, my friends loved it! thanks so much for posting it"
947839,105069,2010-08-24,0,"I made this thinking it would be fun to make a polish dish for my part polish husband. We liked it a lot. I used button and bella mushrooms. I would add more sour cream next time and maybe omit the lemon juice, but it was great as is too!"
296809,59389,2008-06-11,4,"This is an excellent, easy-fix side-dish w/tons of flavor that we enjoyed for dinner w/simple poached fish fillets that really needed to be jazzed up a bit. I did have to use dried herbs & the Icelandic equivalent of the alouette, but it is very close to the real thing. I was a bit unsure early on Re peeling the potatoes or not + cooking them sliced or whole, but eventually opted to cook them sliced & unpeeled which worked well. I did not grease my baking dish & suggest deleting that as the olive oil does that job. The combo of herbs + alouette gives this a very good flavor & the surprise was how much the bell pepper added to the flavor, texture & of course the presentation. Thx for sharing this recipe w/us. :-)"
1232243,59389,2009-04-15,5,This is wonderful and super easy!  I work with Alouette and this is exactly why I love our cheeses. It's just not for dipping!  :)
254633,207525,2007-01-26,5,These r just awesome! I`ll be making them now for r Super Bowl party but i will call them Go Colt`s Party Ryes.............
223169,207525,2007-01-27,4,"""Go Bears!"" ...and with these rhyes you have already a winner. Easy to make and you can prepare them easily in advance. So you will have time enough to watch the Superbowl 2007."
221044,207525,2007-02-02,4,"Pretty intense (between sausage & cheese, and I'm a cheese FREAK 8-), but good and filling!  Used leftovers next night to enhance a frozen pizza.  Not bad!"
36056,207525,2007-02-03,5,"I have made these for years at Christmas brunch as all the kids request them, awesome recipe for an apetizer"
29782,207525,2007-02-05,4,Had this for one of our appetizers for the Superbowl party this year at our house. I couldn't find rye cocktail bread so I just used french style (small sliced) bread. I added minced garlic along with the garlic powder and rest of ingredients. Still was really good but I bet would be better with rye bread. I will be making these again :) Thanks for the recipe!
355804,207525,2007-02-08,3,"Well, I was optimistic...but this appetizer didn't do it for me.  I had a house full of people for a Superbowl party. (Bears vs. Colts - 2007)  And there was quite a bit leftover.  Once it cooled the meat combo became ""gummy"".  Maybe it was because we were rooting for the Colts?"
474189,207525,2007-03-30,5,"Froze and used these for 3 different get-togethers and got great comments.  Best served warm,, but taste good room temperature too."
492888,207525,2007-05-25,5,"My kind of snack -- easy, makes a lot, and people like them."
38643,207525,2007-07-05,5,I love this recipe and have been making it for years. I put some pizza sauce on the bread. These are great to have in the freezer for a quick appetizer.
311566,207525,2007-10-22,5,These are great appetizers...I did a freezer meal session and made these. Quick to whip together. Thanks!
483703,207525,2008-01-31,5,"My mom made these all my life for partys. She called the ""Mrs. Somebody's Mistakes"".  We love these, especially DH.  These are a GREAT SuperBowl item, because in my opinion, all superbowl food should be finger foods! :)"
508148,207525,2009-02-04,4,"My Grandma used to make these when I was young.   I made these for our super bowl party and  most everyone seemed to enjoy them.  I halved the recipe.  Thanks for sharing this one, brings back fond memories."
99624,207525,2010-02-06,5,"My mom used to make these.  We called them ""Little Pizza's"". They're great to have in the freezer - just pull out a few for a quick snack."
198154,207525,2010-02-07,3,"I made these for superbowl. DD ate the topping off of one, I had 2 and DH had 4 Everyone's opinion was a little different. So we averaged it to 3 stars.  Thanks for the tip on how to freeze them.  I'll freeze what is left and DH can pop 4 into the oven when he needs to grab something quick."
1802842582,207525,2014-10-05,4,"This recipe has been around for at least 45 years, believe it or not.  My sister-in-law&#039;s mom used to make them when I was little, and then my sis-in-law took over.  She uses a hot sausage, so I don&#039;t care for them  But with a mild or sage sausage, they are terrific."
2000498330,207525,2016-06-05,5,"Have loved this appetizer since I was a teen. Called them Polish Mistakes--no clue why. I use 1 T Worcestershire. Must be served hot, right out of the oven. Crazy good."
136997,176110,2010-07-22,5,Very nice dressing. I halved the recipe and it worked just fine. Made for Facebook ABC Tag.
1622913,176110,2011-02-21,5,I just finished making this salad dressing and it is absolutely delicious!  I was a little concerned about the amount of pepper at first but I followed your recipe exactly and am now thrilled that our Chef's Salad dinner tonight will taste wonderful with this dressing!  Love it!  Thank you Theresa P.!
199020,176110,2014-03-10,5,"Great dressing and different from anything else I&#039;ve ever made! And, I&#039;ve made lots of salad dressings. I cut the recipe in half and served it over chef salads. I think it would be awesome over taco salads, too! Thanks for sharing!"
42249488,176110,2014-04-03,5,"This recipe was spot on!  I made a serving of this recipe for my chef salad lunch.  It was delish! I changed it up...I used honey instead of sugar, cayenne pepper instead of tabasco sauce, and olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  My, my, my. The other ingredients I added more or less by how the original recipe incorporated--meaning, if the recipe called for a tsp of something, I would do a sprinkle.  Awesome!"
638893,190108,2008-08-03,5,Very good... I changed it a little didn't measure everything but it turned out great my husband has had jambalaya in red lobster and a few other places but definitely perfers this one!! Thank you!
59473,64302,2003-07-05,4,I made this salad to take to a pool party today. It was a nice change from the usual mayo or Italian dressing macaroni salad. Everyone really enjoyed it. I will certainly make this one again. Thanks for posting.
9579,64302,2004-09-19,5,I cut this recipe in half since I was making for just me and I loved it. The dressing reminds me of the Western French Dressing that is one of my favorites. Thanks for the recipe. Next time I'll have to make the whole recipe.
247358,64302,2005-09-28,5,Terrific hit with salad beans!
444944,64302,2010-09-11,0,"I first had this at my parent's house and was pleasantly surprised! Add a couple of tins of shrimp or some fresh cooked shrimp, lobster or crab and it's fabulousness increases exponentially!"
266603,143750,2006-11-25,5,This soup is GREAT!
265638,143750,2007-07-10,4,"Used fresh cooked pumpkin that I had left over from night before, and didn't have allspice, but made recipe otherwise unchanged.  DH is a non-banana man, and found the banana taste a bit much, I think next time I'd also enjoy it more with half as much banana. A delicious recipe, definite comfort food.  Imagine being able to put condensed milk in your soup!! Yum."
143318,143750,2014-11-13,4,This soup is the bomb! It was a bit too sweet for me with the sweetened milk and ripe banana. Next time I will use a less ripe banana. Also Step #5 is unnecessary because you already process the soup to be smooth in Step #3.
521192,251528,2007-09-15,4,This was really yummy and really easy!
292868,251528,2007-10-27,4,My husband and I loved this...so easy to prepare.  I plan to do it tomorrow for a potluck.
373083,251528,2007-12-30,4,Made this a couple of times.  Big hit with the grandkids and DH alike.  This is a keeper!
163872,47366,2005-01-15,4,"This is pretty good!  I made a couple of minor substitutions:  I don't have beef bouillion because I usually have beef stock on hand, so I used the stock instead of the water and bouillion.  If I were to use bouillion, I would leave out the 2-1/2 tsp salt.  I seared the beef in a skillet on high heat, then deglazed the pan with a little red wine, putting that in the crockpot, too.  I added garlic and used fresh herbs.  The Beau had 3 helpings!"
857489,47366,2009-02-05,2,This recipe isn't very tasty and no one was impressed. I have had much better minestrone soup. I won't bother with this recipe again. It just didn't have the right taste to us-bland. Sorry.
95743,20223,2003-11-05,5,"This is quite yummy. I've never heard of cretons before and didn't really know what to expect.  It's a very thick, loose meat concoction that tastes great heated and served over toast. I haven't tried it cold on toast yet, and that me be the usual way of eating this. Wish it were true but I don't believe the nutrition facts presented here.  I was fairly certain I wouldn't like as much cinnamon and cloves as the recipe called for, so I used half the recommended amount.  That was fine for my tastes. Cook over very low heat and stir very frequently-it scorches quite easily.  A delicious way to get your morning protein."
9748,20223,2003-11-10,5,"This recipe epitomizes what I love about 'Zaar; just when you think you have heard it all, someone comes up with a delicious new thing to try!  I made this exactly as written, and it did smell yummy while it was cooking.  Tried it out on my breakfast toast this morning - SO GOOD!!  I can't eat cottage cheese, and I get sick of having a boiled egg every morning - now I have a delicious alternative!  Try it, you'll like it!"
156376,20223,2004-08-07,5,My husband is Acadian from New Brunswick and he always pines for his mama's Creton.  I found this recipe and liked it because of the lower-fat twist to it.  I made it and we both thought it tasted just as good as his mother's!  (BTW - the natives like to eat it on some whole grain toast with some mustard slathered on top - YUMMY!)  Thanks for posting this!
159084,20223,2004-09-05,5,"Currently living in Southwestern Ontario, I was born and raised in Quebec...Cretons is something I crave, but only get on trips home (which is good for the waistline!) The recipe is easy and delicious; the next time I make this I will be cutting down on the amount of clove (for my Husband) it is slighthly overpowering.  THanks so much for this lighter version!"
245002,149887,2006-10-06,5,"I have made this recipe countless times and it is incredible, let me tell you. This recipe has made me locally famous as the person to bring breakfast treats ANYWHERE (kids activities, work parties, family gatherings, etc.). I have two minor changes to this recipe. I use anywhere from 3/4 to the entire package of vanilla pudding mix in the bread part of the recipe. I also add orange extract and substitute orange juice for the milk used in the frosting. I make this recipe without a bread machine and the dough is slightly sticky to work with, depending on the humidity level. Also, rise times may be quite a bit longer than specified in the recipe, depending on the relative humidity and temperature. Don't be intimidated by that, just be patient because these cinnamon rolls are DEFINITELY worth it. And yes, they are quite a bit better than Cinabon in my opinion - mainly because the bread part of this recipe is slightly sweet, aromatic, and moist, with a tender crumb. It is also the only recipe I've found that doesn't depend on getting a huge bite of the filling in order to be flavorful (which means that in the event you end up with thicker parts of the roll or an end piece isn't such a let down when biting into it.)"
1800286047,149887,2013-11-20,5,These are so good!  My nephews went crazy for them and they are picky.  I am making a double batch for Thanksgiving breakfast.  My mom liked them so much she asked me to make some for the nurses who take care of my grandma.  Thanks
95262,52443,2003-08-22,4,This was very tasty.  I decided to double up the recipe and add some chopped pepperoni sausage and we made a full meal out of it.  It is not filling enough for a mainmeal without it.
320994,52443,2006-07-03,4,"I agree with silky's review.  Very tasty indeed.  I think next time I will add some chopped pepperonis, as she suggested, and possibly ramp up the garlic powder and oregano for a more intense flavor.  When doubled up, this makes a great no-leftovers meal for 2!  Also there is minimal cleanup afterwards--always a plus!"
189616,87098,2005-03-01,5,"This was great, certainly a time saver not having to do all that chopping! I added cooked ground beef and cooked macaroni so that my husband would eat it.
Thanks SmrJunior!"
369715,87098,2009-01-05,4,"This was a good base soup. I followed the recipe except I didn't have canned zucchini, so used peas. I also used fresh shredded carrots and celery as they needed to be used up. I used diced tomatoes with oregano and basil but we thought the soup needed a lot more seasoning. I did add some salt and pepper but it still was missing something. This also reheated nicely for lunches. I also simmered mine a lot longer then the recipe called for. I simmered for about an hour. I too added hamburger so my family would be happy."
254614,220186,2007-04-03,5,"This is a DELICIOUS POTATO SALAD!
I use the same dressing as listed but add 1/2 tsp celery seed. In the summertime I add thin slices of red radish and thin slivers of jicama. But you are so right, don't substitute mayo, use Miracle Whip, it has the right zip to this salad."
61995,220186,2007-04-04,5,"Totally agree!  I'm not a big miracle whip fan, but that is the only way I like my potato salad!  It makes such a difference!"
428885,220186,2007-04-18,5,"Well, count me in as another person who hasn't cared for Miracle Whip, but surprise, surprise....this potato salad was delicious. Your right, it did add a special (smooth) taste that enhanced the potato salad, not detracted. I also (as suggested by another reviewer) added celery seed, and a bit of chives to the top. Other then that, followed recipe completely. Wouldn't change a thing, except you are going to want to double it next time, it's that good! Thanks I Cook Therefore I Am!"
234912,220186,2007-05-11,5,"This will be my new potato salad recipe.  I have always loved Miracle Whip, my husband is only into Hellmans.  Well he loved this potato salad.  It was nice and creamy and very tasty.  Thanks for posting.
ChefRaylene"
479327,220186,2007-05-14,5,"I hate Miracle Whip, but love this potato salad says it all.  Only change I made was to use less celery and onions.  Wonderful!  Thanks for posting."
29667,220186,2007-06-16,5,"I made this recently for myself.  This was really delicious!  I added a tsp of celery seed and chopped chives to the finished dish, as other reviewers suggested.  I left out the celery and onions, but next time I will try them in it.  I also made this a second time for our Memorial Day BBQ.  My whole family raved about it!  I gave my parents the leftovers to take home and my mother said she ate some for breakfast everyday.  I like that this recipe was very easy to make, and tasted awesome!"
145352,220186,2007-07-03,5,"Very good, basic potato salad! Perfect for our picnic dinner!"
361931,220186,2007-07-05,4,"This was good.  Left out the celery because I was out.  This makes a LOT, so make sure that you have a LARGE bowl :)  Took this to a family gathering and got lots of compliments.  The only thing I would change would be to add a little salt, as it was a little sweet -- but that is a personal preference :)"
357358,220186,2008-07-07,5,"DH *really* liked this. We both like Miracle Whip, but I thought the finished product needed some zing, so I added some hot sauce and parsley to the dressing which turned out more to my taste. I did not have celery so I added 1/2 teaspoon celery seed. Next time I will add relish because I believe it would taste great in this recipe. Thanks!"
597480,220186,2008-09-18,4,"I am not a fan of miracle whip...and I was excited because I have been looking for a potato salad recipe for the freezer since I do OAMC and mayo doesn't freeze. But as for the taste, I thought this potato salad was just ok.. I really tasted the miracle whip. My FH liked it ok too. It turned out that it doesn't freeze well.. it gets watery. I couldn't figure out why, then I realized that while everything else in my salad freezes well (I didn't put onions or celery) cooked egg whites don't freeze! I'll probably make this again because I really want a freezer potato salad and hopefully without the cooked egg whites it will freeze better. All in all, I think you'll like it, especially if you already like miracle whip"
683464,220186,2010-05-08,4,"This was pretty good.  I substituted 1 1/2 T onion powder for the fresh onions because I don't like raw onions.  I also left out the celery because I don't like raw celery.  This salad has a bit of a zing.  I think that I would like it better if it had more yellow mustard, so next time I make this I might try adding more."
1469340,220186,2011-04-13,5,"My usual potato salad recipe is my Mom's...which is made with mayo. Since I was out of mayo and had Miracle Whip on hand (we are a mayo AND Miracle Whip family and usually have both) I was specifically looking for a potato salad recipe that called for MW. Glad I found this one! I had to tinker a bit as I didn't have all the ingredients and my most of my family don't like celery, but the end result was very delicious and even tasted quite a bit like the Deviled Egg Potato salad that is to die for at our local grocery deli (which I have not been able to replicate...until now).<br/><br/>I used celery salt and onion powder instead of the real thing, used a spicy brown beer mustard, and added a splash of Red Hot, a splash of a mild clear pepper sauce (LaBelle's No 5), and paprika. Couldn't keep myself from ""testing"" the sauce while I waited for the potatoes to cook. It was even good spread on a sourdough whole wheat rosemary and olive oil cracker! Served along side grilled chicken breasts for supper and it totally hit the spot. Thanks! I'm keeping this one for sure!"
2001181180,220186,2016-09-24,5,This is the best potato salad I've ever made. Definitely my go to recipe from now on. I'm going to use it to make my macaroni salad to from now on!
2002169234,220186,2018-05-29,0,"This recipe is very similar to the old-school version my mom always made, except that she had a habit of adding very thinly sliced fresh radishes if they were available (and absolutely crispy-fresh) and then garnishing with plenty of paprika. Another tip to avoid the leftovers from getting watery once refrigerated: make sure to drain the boiled potatoes very well once they've initially cooled and stir up all of the wet ingredients thoroughly."
28177,354039,2009-02-20,2,"This recipe sounded like a slam dunk & was one of the first I picked to try.  Unfortunately I did not notice that the honey isn't mentioned in the instructions & although there were several places I could guess to add it, I didn't want to post something negative regarding the role of such a large amount of honey if it turned out that I chose the wrong place to use it.  So I left it out.  The result without the honey was just too dry.  DS (a huge veggie eater) didn't like the carrots in the bundle at all, but DH & I were fine with them.  I wasn't sure if there was another typo in the ingredient list & there should have been two cans of crescent roll dough listed because when the 8 rolls were made I still had 16 slices (a full apple), 3 TBL of seasonings & 1/4 cup carrot leftover.  Enough to make another 8 rolls. All in all this recipe was okay & I would normally assign 3 stars but I have to knock off a star for missing the honey as without it the recipe doesn't have enough ingredients to qualify for the contest.  :(
Thank you, chef for your creation!  Made for RSC Lucky #13."
220348,354039,2009-02-20,4,"First of all I had to figure out where the honey went so I put a tablespoon in each mixture just before sealing it for cooking. Since I love honey I thought it was really good. Secondly, 20 minutes was the right amount for my oven, so I had no issue with that. Apart from the apple slices being slightly mushy it was really good."
424680,354039,2010-02-14,5,"Made this using 2 smallish Fuji apples & cut back a little on the cardamom, but other than that, followed the recipe & had 8 very nice tasting apple treats! Easy to make & a satisfying combo of flavors! [Made & reviewed in Healthy Choices ABC tag]"
498271,354039,2011-03-25,4,"Great little treats!  I didn't peel my apple, otherwise made as directed.  I didn't need all of the sugar/spice mixture so would make half the amount next time.  The cardamom and honey flavors were great with the apples.  Thanks for posting this recipe!"
229832,130815,2005-07-25,3,I made this in the little foil disposable pans. I only got 7 out of the recipe. The texture is good but I think it needs more flavor.. I might try it again and add choc chips. Thanks... 
235198,130815,2007-06-25,5,"Absolutely wonderful, thanks for sharing."
526654,130815,2007-07-07,3,"turned out real good
gilcamp4"
540523,130815,2007-07-19,3,I liked the texture but it needed more flavor I added more cinn. and choc chips and made cream cheese icing. It was good Thanks!!!
164182,130815,2007-09-05,5,"Very nice.  I didn't in anyway thing this lacked flavor.  Perhaps the I hate zucchini fooled them into thinking it would taste like chocolate cake.  I was surprise that only a teaspoon of soda made it rise so nicely, but it did.  I used oil because I was sure it would be the easiest to stir, and it was very easy to stir by hand.  I am going to attempt to health it up a bit the next time and go half apple sauce in place of the oil.

I did add a little flax seed in place of nuts."
458927,130815,2007-11-30,5,fabulous! i used a touch more zucchini and  about 1/2 cup sugar.  I also used olive oil and you could not taste it.  Super good.
409584,130815,2008-07-17,5,Delicious! I made 3 loaves last night and by this afternoon only one is left! :)
611548,130815,2008-08-08,5,Yummy.  I used whole wheat flour and a little extra baking soda.  The recipe adapted well.
838679,130815,2008-08-16,5,This was very good.  I also added 8 oz. of crushed (drained) pineapple.  That sure made it moist and yummy!
262962,130815,2009-06-21,5,Loved this recipe!  Will make over and over again =)
925024,130815,2009-07-16,5,"Excellent!  I definately would use an extra egg to add moisture.  It was wonderful.

:)"
296027,244840,2007-08-16,4,"Very nice lower-fat gravy.  i seasoned and refridgerated the meat overnight as directed.  The only change I did make was to the final gravy - we needed a bit more spice/seasoning for that part to suit our tastes so I added dried onions, cajun/creole seasoning, garlic and black pepper.  Nice flavor and we relly liked the turkey - it is something we make as a hamburger gravy alternative.  Thanks for posting a great recipe!!!"
336058,244840,2007-10-13,5,"The only drawback to this recipe is that it is a ""plan ahead"" type meal.  I had to remember to make the meat the night before! :lol:  I used regular ground turkey and drained the fat.  I thought 1 tsp of dried minced onions was not much, so I used 1/2 tsp onion powder and added some dried in with the browning.  First time we made it my 13 yod made it unsupervised and used condensed milk!  The evap. is much better! :lol:  Made with kluski type noodles.  The kids gobbled it down.  Thanks so much!"
169430,244840,2008-02-18,0,"I'm not staring this recipe because I used it as a base idea and then turned it into healthy biscuits and gravy. I made the gravy using the milks, onion flakes, garlic powder, marjoram, flour, salt and pepper. When the gravy was almost ready I added Yves Ground Round (veggie meat). I did need to add a tsp of cornstarch to get it to my desired thickness. This made a delicious brekkie that was easy and quick to make. It was wonderful to have ""back home"" food without all the fat and calories."
58104,120297,2005-10-04,3,Sorry! But I found these very dry and not that good! I did sprinkle with oil. Sorry! Maybe someone else will find these to there sense of taste.
209747,120297,2006-03-31,3,Sorry Blue! I agree with Rita. This just was not well received by my family. since Rita said they were dry I increased the yogurt to 1 cup but that didn't seem to really help. Maybe some good olive oil or butter in the potato mixture? Sorry! 
38182,120297,2006-04-01,4,"The chickpeas were new to me, but I liked them. I also liked the tang of the yogurt.  I added a little sprinkle of paprika for color. We had pickled turnips on the side. Very tasty. Might be good with a sprinkle of feta cheese crumbles on top also."
385678,120297,2008-07-18,5,"These turned out to be really nice ""middle eastern"" style twice baked potatoes!  I liked your adjustments of adding 2 cloves garlic and 1 Tablespoon tahini though honestly I ended up using 3 large galic cloves (I'm a big garlic lover!) and 3 Tablespoons total of the tahini (also a big tahini lover).  I also added 2 teaspoons of Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar for our own taste though it tasted nice already before I added it.  They are healthier than most twice baked potatoes which is also a real plus for me and I always love trying something new!  Thanks!  Made for Zaar Tag."
620828,318677,2008-12-11,5,This was great!   I brought it to a staff lunch and everyone was asking me about it!
199848,318677,2012-12-16,5,"Great salad!  It's tasty and filling and much easier to prepare than rolling actual California rolls.  I used sushi rice and spring mix lettuce.  I didn't use the pickled ginger, but I did sprinkle sesame seeds over the salad to serve.   Thanx for sharing this!"
594992,144952,2007-09-23,5,Delicious
760576,144952,2008-02-12,5,"Absolutely delicious.  We used tons of cheese (not sure if we followed the recipe on that!) and followed the recipe exactly otherwise.  It wasn't very hard to make, it took a while but wasn't much work.  Yummy, and we got 4 servings as well."
5060,33606,2003-09-22,5,"This was worth more than 5*, I took it to a luncheon at work today, there was not a speck left.Everyone loved the fact that it was not the ordinary mayo laden pasta salad. There was lots of crunch with the peppers and water chestnuts; the dill pickles and black olives with the spices livened it up. I used cubed smoked chicken and cubed sharp cheddar.  The only thing I did differently was to add 3 tablespoons of hot relish to give it a little bite.  We all enjoyed it very much and will make it again for a large gathering; it does make a lot!!  Thanks for sharing."
120264,33606,2010-07-01,5,This was wonderful!  We enjoyed this tremendously on a hot summer night.  Good flavor combo.
131126,197001,2006-11-23,5,"This recipe is very popular for holidays and potlucks in my area. I make it exactly like your recipe and it is always a hit. I prefer this version with marshmellows and pecans. They add fluffiness and a crunch and contribute to the appearance of the dish. It is VERY rich, a pretty light pink color,  and tastes wonderful! Thank you for posting the recipe!"
352814,197001,2007-05-22,5,I usually make it without the marshmallows and it is always a hit!  Very yummy!
571134,197001,2007-09-15,5,"OH SO YUMMY! Not to mention, so darn simple! I made this for a double baby shower (Thrown for myself and my cousin - We're both having girls) and the ""Pink Stuff"" was PERFECT for the pink theme. Thank you for sharing. I'll find many reasons to make this one again!"
398694,197001,2007-12-11,5,"My husband's aunt made this for Thanksgiving and I immediately asked her for the recipe, and here it is!!! I think I added drained mandarin oranges too though. Delicious, simple, and should def. be a dessert (IMO)!!!"
740120,197001,2008-03-10,5,"I make this for Christmas every year.  It's so rich, but so easy! It can be made in a matter of minutes."
547671,197001,2008-03-10,0,"I too have a recipe we call ""pink stuff""!  I thought it was exclusive!  My daughter and nephews name it that and now at holidays they want to make sure there will be ""pink stuff"".  Mine has cherry juice mixed w/cream cheese, pineapple tidbits, frozen strawberries (drained), mini marshmallows, walnuts and cool whip.  Maybe someone would like to try my version too!"
42290,197001,2008-03-22,5,"Oh my, this is good! I made it for Easter, but I am not sure it is going to make it. I did mix in some sour cream to cut the sweetness a little bit - but otherwise followed the recipe. I am surprised how much it made - had to transfer it to a really big bowl to mix it all up."
881518,197001,2008-09-09,5,"Oh, gosh this was wonderful. I also love to cook, but am also a single/.widow...sixty, and for a single woman who loves to cook, sometimes I feel a little foolish, but there are always people that love a meal brought to them.. so I cook...it is my passion, and basically share with friends, since my children live far away....so please just keep those wonderful recipes coming! Cindy"
56251,197001,2008-10-27,5,"I made this for the Think Pink event, and so glad that I did!  This is so yummy, and super easy, two steps, how simple is that!  Plus it makes a lot.  This is going to be served for my in-laws when they come for the holidays.  I made exactly as directed, did add pecans and marshmallows, yum!  I even had to have a small bowl before it chilled it looked so good!  I love this recipe, thanks for posting!"
679759,197001,2008-11-08,5,"This tastes great, looks pretty and if those two aren't enough...it's super easy to make!
Great recipe!  May have to make this for an extra dish for Thanksgiving."
199020,197001,2008-11-12,5,LOVE IT!  I added extra marshmallows and only used half of the sweetened condensed milk.  I can't imagine it needing to be any sweeter.  This one will definitely be added to my collection.  I wonder how it would taste with blueberry pie filling instead...
1015359,197001,2008-11-16,0,TOO SWEET.....Weird flavor ...not sure how it got a 5 star
135271,197001,2009-02-14,5,"Years ago, this was made for my wedding.  I remember the reactions, people wondered what the heck it was.  Then they tried it, and it was gone in about a half an hour.
I like this, and I do not like pineapple.  But it works in this recipe."
960191,197001,2009-04-13,5,I felt quilty taking this to a family gathering.  It was just too easy to make! Everyone loved it.  I didnot use the nuts and I am sure I used more than a cup of marshmellows.  Youngest to oldest enjoyed this dish.  I am sure my boys will be asking for more of this!
424680,197001,2009-07-20,5,"Made this recipe then divided it between 2 containers so that half could be taken to a neighbor couple who also enjoy this kind of thing! I did toast the pecans & left out the marshmallows, though another time I might just add them! VERY TASTY, VERY SATISFYING, & very easy to prepare! Thanks for sharing the recipe! [Tagged made & reviewed in Zaar Cookbook Tag]"
1359193,197001,2009-08-21,5,I made this dessert for my daughter's birthday party!  Everyone LOVED IT!!!!  Soooo easy to make and sooooo good!
94865,197001,2009-09-06,5,"I laughed when I saw this because it's a family favorite and we also call it ""pink stuff.""  We freeze it and serve it slightly softened, as a dessert.  I've never added the marshmallows because my husband isn't fond of them, but it certianly isn't lacking without them.  Whenever I bring this to a potluck I get lots of requests for the recipe."
748983,197001,2009-10-07,5,"This was SO good! I added the marshmallows, but not the pecans. I'm not a big fan of them. I love that it's so easy to make. When my dad tried it, he said you could make a meal out of it. I will definitely be making this again."
1196284,197001,2009-11-21,5,Our family calls it Cherry Fluff and my mom used to make it all the time!!  It is always a hit; newcomers ask for the recipe often.
175824,197001,2010-08-05,5,"This was delicious. I think it would make a nice pie. Next time I make it I am going to put it a graham cracker pie crust. I couldn't stop eating this. I took it to work and the minute it was tasted, I had to print out the recipe. Thanks for such a quick and yummy recipe."
416985,197001,2010-10-04,5,"This is the best!! I didn't add pecans, b/c the rest of the family -usually- doesn't like them, but THIS TIME, they AGREED they would be great in this, so that's what I get to do next time (YAY-) I remember having this at the holidays, but haven't had it in awhile, so I'm so happy that I can bring this DELICIOUS tradition back!!Thanks so much!!"
426135,197001,2011-02-15,5,My kids love this the only thing I do differently is I dump the whole bag of mini marshmallows in since my kids like it that way. I also dont add pecans because not all my kids like them.
136511,197001,2011-05-30,5,My Nana used to make this for the holidays.  It is so easy to make and tastes amazing.  I made this for a Memorial Day bbq I was having.  Everyone loved it!  Will definitely be making this again and again.
394900,197001,2012-04-07,5,"I made this and it was so amazing.  Instead of mixing in the nuts, I left them on the side because my kids don't like them.  Will make this again and again..."
454149,197001,2012-12-26,5,My family loved this! Thanks for the recipe! :)
1803472249,197001,2014-12-07,0,I make this salad a few times a year.  I add a can of mandarin oranges drained and leave out the condensed milk.  The pie filling and other fruits along with the marshmallows and cool whip make it plenty sweet.....
588863,197001,2014-12-28,5,My adult family likes this recipe during the holidays. It&#039;s simply a fun food. I follow the recipe exactly with the exception of adding a little sweetened coconut.Thanks for posting!
2001432090,197001,2017-03-13,0,i have made this before and i love it. but i have a question if a person has ibs is it ok to eat this without any problems ?
2000044434,197001,2018-01-04,5,"Made recipe exactly as written, and it turned out great! It makes a lot, so I put it in two separate containers. My husband usually will not even try something that looks like this, but he absolutely loves this!!!"
2505393,197001,2018-05-21,5,"I made this to take to a small family &quot;get-together&quot;. I made a few alterations, but everyone still raved about it! The changes I made were minor. I didn't make the &quot;full&quot; recipe as I forgot to buy whipped cream and had a different size in my freezer. Also I'd mistakenly picked up a can of pineapple tidbits instead of crushed - so that's what I used. Also since my hubby is diabetic I left out the sweetened condensed milk - I felt it was sweet enough without it. The last thing I did I read in a review on here....added a touch of coconut. I was told that I could add more of that (I didn't add much - again due to hubby). The end result....Well, let's just say I returned home with an empty dish to put in the dishwasher! I'll definitely be making it again...not only to &quot;take&quot; but for a quick dessert at home. Thanks."
44420,30131,2007-08-03,5,Why haven't I reviewed this before?  I've used it on both chicken and steaks and it is a terrific marinade.  Thanks for posting.
440324,30131,2012-10-29,5,I used it on shrimp and even though it turned them a bit brown they tasted great. Can't wait to try it on some beef. Thank you.
337963,165270,2008-08-23,4,"LOVED IT!  I agree the Italian dressing added a very nice flavor.  I browned the meat first then put all the ingredients in the crockpot at the same time and it turned out beautifully.  Thank you for posting!  Made for the Photo Forum's Crockpot Event, please see my rating system as I rate tougher than most."
422893,165270,2013-01-08,4,"This was nice although I would have liked it a little richer in flavour, I think some tomato paste would have made all the difference. I threw all the ingredients in the slow cooker and served it with rice for a simple dinner."
128473,522861,2015-08-26,5,"This was wonderful momaphet.  We enjoyed this tasty dish very much.  Made exactly as written and wouldn&#039;t change a thing.  Served with apple sauce on the side.  OMG, The flavor from the garlic, cheese, fried onions and apple sauce  is out of this world good.  We enjoyed it very much and will be having this again often. Who knew that apple sauce with noodles would be so comforting.  Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe.  Made for CQ2 - Family Picks."
115964,109439,2005-08-01,3,"I tried this on a turkey sandwish, but I thought the horseradish was a little to over powering."
26478,18537,2002-02-06,4,This was a great recipe.  It was easy to prepare and tasted wonderful.  I only had plain applesauce so I add 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the applesauce also.  It turned out really well.
18391,18537,2002-02-22,4,"I used chicken breasts, as we don't eat pork .. cooked it in the crockpot on low for 7 hours .. very easy and good .."
28671,18537,2002-02-26,4,"These were simple to make.  DH loved the flavor of apples with the pork.  I used canned ""fried apples"" that were nice and chunky.  It worked out well."
32326,18537,2002-04-10,0,"Made the wait forever porkchops my husband and kids did not like them, found the clove flavour over powering"
142014,18537,2004-11-15,4,"I used apricots instead of applesauce, added cinnamon & ginger & left out the cloves (I don't like them personally).  It was great & easy to prepare."
4470,18537,2005-03-01,5,"Great simple do ahead recipe.  I used a fresh apple, peeled it and coarsley chopped it pot the apple over the browned chop,in a baking dish added cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg, covered the dish and baked in 300F oven fo almost 2 hours - result- moist tasty chop- It's a winner Terri F - "
574849,18537,2007-08-30,4,"It was great!!!! I was looking for a recipe for pork chops and I spotted this one. Its was easy,fast, and good."
1711936,18537,2010-10-23,5,Made this for the family tonight and they loved it... I did make extra applesauce  and used it to spoon over the pork chops as goober sauce. I served the chops with mashed sweet potatoes with the goober sauce over them... YUMMY
1178163,18537,2014-02-05,5,Awesome!  My whole family loves this recipe.  The pork came out perfectly tender.  Used just regular applesauce.  The only thing I did differently was use cinnamon instead of cloves.
140806,152259,2006-01-20,5,"This is a good smoothie recipe, nice and mild and not too sweet. DH drank most of it! I used fresh bananas and added a little frozen mango. Thanks for posting!"
319735,152259,2006-06-26,3,Goooooooooooooooooood its kinda tangy
258688,152259,2006-06-27,4,"Great recipe- easy to substitute :)
I don't like yogurt in my smoothies, and substituted for fat-free raspberry sherbet. I added some blueberries too (I was going for the BananaBerry Smoothie @ JambaJuice). Turned out great- thanks!!"
124249,152259,2006-08-11,4,"We enjoyed this thick and creamy smoothie. Easy to prepare. Made as written. 

Thanks philocrates.

Bullwinkle."
430471,152259,2007-04-18,5,This is great. Very healthy and yummy.
407007,152259,2007-05-02,5,"wonderful, wonderful! my mom and I both loved this smoothie. great on a hot day! no sugar needed! sweet and delish!"
700872,152259,2007-12-23,4,=d
587114,152259,2008-03-01,5,"Wonderful, a perfect smoothie recipe at last!"
810603,152259,2008-04-06,5,Simply Delicious!  It only takes minutes to make and tastes great!
1646541,152259,2010-07-04,5,"Wow! I can't wait to make it!!! I always wanted Jamba Juice every morning, but my parents wouldn't take me. Now I can have some of it when ever I want!!! :)"
2543922,152259,2012-12-28,5,Really good recipe for a smoothie. May I suggest using less Banana (use about 1/4-1/2 of a banana depending on your thickness level)
2000378365,152259,2015-08-05,5,Really good! Added some raspberries to it :)
88342,42198,2003-08-04,0,"You shouldn't be recommending eating raw eggs without a serious warning.  The volumn of the ""BOX"" of sugar wuld be helpfull too."
37229,42198,2004-07-07,5,"Very yummy! I didn't realize my 8x8 pan was dirty so I had to use a slightly smaller dish and less strawberries and cream as a result, but it turned out wonderful! I took it to my inlaws for 4th of July and there was almost nothing left! I only had 2 cups of powdered sugar and it was almost too sweet. I'd definetly not use a whole 16 oz box. I will definetly make this again! Sooooo Good! Thanks for the recipie!"
35526,42198,2004-08-02,4,"I used a half a box of sugar and it was plenty sweet.  Not sure what happened but alot of the vanilla wafer crumbs never got wet enough to be a part of the dessert.  Loved the taste though as did  my guests.  I will be making this again but will experiment with the sugar, egg and butter mixture to make it a little runnier maybe."
195984,42198,2005-02-15,5,I have looked for years for this recipe. My aunt made it when I was a child and I loved it. I thought it was called French Strawberry Pudding. I tried to make it from the memory of watching her. It was the eggs I left out. Thanks so much.
545717,42198,2008-05-17,5,"Delicious! The only change I made was that I used egg substitute in place of the eggs, it worked fine. Thank you for sharing this refreshing dessert."
869635,151143,2014-11-20,0,"I thought this recipe was excellent, will definitely make it again."
65056,39959,2005-05-21,5,"This certainly is a blessing!  I had to omit the burnet root as I could not find it.  I've been taking it by just putting a half tsp in my mouth and then washing it down with some cold water and then some hot water.  I think the hot water is a necessary step- it really makes me feel like this is working a bit more and has really gotten washed down.  Be forewarned-  don't try and make a tea out of this! I tried that... ewwwwwww.  Bitter, bitter, bitter!  So, stick with taking it with some water or putting it in a gelatin tablet.  It works wonders though- I really feel that when I take it I find that my mind feels much clearer and I feel more like I can take on the task at hand, rather than panicking.  When I took this before bed, I found that I slept much more soundly and woke up feeling much more refreshed.  Thank you, Sharon for this treasure."
782064,257409,2008-06-16,5,Very tasty and very filling for a vegetable sandwich! I'll definitely keep it on rotation.
1354833,257409,2009-08-17,5,Thanks Uncle Moochie! I needed a good recipe to use up tomatoes and zucs from my garden. Very yummy!!
38405,27087,2002-05-07,3,"Thick is definitely accurate.
Not bad, but it was a little TOO much for my tastes.  It was so thick, it was a little hard to handle without making a mess.
Probably would not make again"
146047,93959,2004-07-24,5,"Awesome muffins!!  I have to be honest and say I was a little skeptical, mostly because I was unsure about the cocoa / yam / orange  combination, but it works, and really well I might add!  The flavors are subtle without being at all bland, and the streusel sets it off perfectly.  My yield was 13 muffins.  Subs:  1/2 c splenda + 1/4 c nonfat dry milk instead of sugar; 3 egg whites + 1 T liquid lecithin instead of 2 eggs."
22015,93959,2004-07-15,4,This is a light & tender muffin.  The spices were a bit strong for me and the streusal topping didn't work out.  I think that the butter needs to be cold and not soft so that it ends up more crumbly.  Mine was pasty.  I'd also double the streusal next time.
47559,29214,2003-07-25,5,"I'm so glad I picked this recipe for the ""pick a chef"" event.  I can't believe this wonderfully creamy and richly flavored mushroom sauce has'nt been reviewed yet.  It tastes much more decadent than the fat grams and calories would indicate.  The multiple reductions gave the mushrooms intense flavor, and the milk mixture provided a creamy texture.  Well worth the time to prepare.  I served it with plain pan-grilled pork chops and rice."
82507,29214,2004-05-24,5,I wish you would bottle this sauce - it was delicious over pork chops.  I was cooking the chops and some cabbage at the same time and I needed two more hands!
511993,29214,2007-06-05,5,Superb! Transforms every day steak and veg into an exceptional gourmet meal.
237330,29214,2008-02-28,5,"Wow, this sauce is amazing! Yes, it takes a bit longer than the usual sauce but it is very much worth it. A definite make again which can be served with so many things. I used the dry sherry and would highly recommend it. Thank you, Manda!"
320849,29214,2008-03-01,5,"I was browsing while waiting on hold, glanced at the recipe, and then had to look back once I was done with my call. I hadn't been looking for a dinner idea, but I realized I had everything for this recipe. I added an onion to the garlic (I used 6 cloves) and mushrooms at the beginning, and then tore up some ham pieces to throw in at the end. I cooked up some egg noodles, which I stirred together with the sauce, and then served with an additional sprinking of grated parm. It definitely tasted richer than its ingredients, and I think it's the bit of mustard, teriyaki, and herbs that gave it just a bit more complexity than is usual with this type of sauce. I guess it's the usual thing...if you're cutting out some fat, you have to add a bit more flavor in return. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
1110169,29214,2009-02-17,5,"this is phenomenal!
it does take a long time to make but well worth the effort - I use crimini mushrooms instead of white - I think portobello mushrooms would be great as well
The teriyaki gives it that saltiness it needs and reducing it in the broth gives an amazing sauce that is definitely more lo-cal than a cream sauce - I skipped the milk powder and corn starch and just simmered for longer to get rid of the extra liquid - I substituted the sherry with cooking burgundy wine - I think it gives it a deeper flavor - served over rice with rosemary pork meatballs!"
730763,29214,2009-04-23,5,I used this as my Beef Stroganoff sauce and it was great.  I just added in the ground beef and some onions and garlic and had it over noodles with sugar snap peas on the side.  Excellent!
586472,29214,2009-06-04,5,This is very good and I believe that it will taste good on all kinds of meat.  I am going to freeze a couple servings to see how it does.  Followed recipe exactly with portabellos but I skipped the milk powder and used 1% milk.  Thanks so much!
131126,336744,2008-11-20,4,"In copying this recipe I made an error & listed 2 pkgs of ramen. I also crushed them uncooked into the bottom of a 8X12 glass pan. I then poured the egg batter over it all & it barely covered the noodles.  After baking the edges of the noodles were crispy.  The whole dish is so pretty when it came out of the oven.  Made as I did, I could see it easily being cut into small squares & served as an inexpensive appetizer on a tray.  The seasoning is good, but needs just a bit of tweaking to get it company ready.  Maybe some salt, onion flakes, and a bit more italian seasoning would finish it up.  It is a very pretty dish & well worth the experimenting!  I do promise to try the recipe as written & will add to my review.  Good luck in the contest!"
186855,336744,2008-11-20,4,"Reminds me of a puffy omelet. This is a very easy, fast and filling dish. Very economical too. Just add salad and you've fed a family of four for only a few dollars. I cut the recipe in half and as I don't care for olives, substituted chopped onions. Next time I'll add a bit of salt and increase the spices. Just to give it a little more zing. This is a great creation."
191533,19208,2009-12-08,5,"Very, very tasty! My mom used to do this... I used macintosh apples and regular white sugar. I have a food mill, so I cooked the apples and pureed them before adding anything else. I melted the candies in a small pan, then added them to the applesauce. After tasting that, I determined how much sugar I needed. (Not much.)"
46545,39226,2002-09-09,5,"This is the best, Carol!!!
I'm making this from now on instead of buying my usual Louisiana hot sauce... which I was addicted to until now.
Very easy to put together and I like that I can alter the salt content (I used half the amount, maybe next time I'll omit it?) and it still turned out fantastic."
52125,39226,2002-11-19,5,What more can I say about this sauce then it is wonderful! Loved it and will be making it lots more. Thanks.
178702,39226,2004-12-06,5,"This sause is great! I made it, and it tasted just like the 'real' thing. My husband couldn't tell the difference. They just never give you enough of the stuff in those little packs, this is great! It took about 10 minutes to make, and, I don't know if I can do this or not, but I didn't have tomato paste so I used ketchup instead...it worked out fine.(I read somewhere you can substitute ketchup for tomato PASTE in a recipe, and I've done it millions of times. it always works for me.) It's the best. Thank you so much for sharing! "
90086,39226,2008-04-13,5,I love this sauce - I have made it several times.. it 'does' taste just like Taco Bell's Fire Sauce! Thanks for posting it..
1220686,39226,2014-12-30,5,"I was excited to find fire sauce in the store, but after our family went through almost the whole bottle in one meal, I figured I&#039;d better find a good alternative. This recipe has almost the same ingredients and tastes very similar side by side. I store it in an old pickle jar and use a small ladle to serve. I make it according to directions except blending the jalepenos in a mini food processor and doubling the corn starch to make it a bit more like the store-bought."
104082,83873,2004-02-14,4,"This fried chicken lives up to its' name!!""Crispy and Crunchy""!!The cream of chicken soup gave the chicken a nice flavour.I didn't have cornstarch so I used flour in it's place and it still turned out.I used the chicken breasts as called for in the recipe,but I think next time I'm going to try it with chicken parts.I might even try and ""double-coat"" them for extra ""crunchiness""!!!!"
1118954,83873,2009-02-08,5,"This is fantastic!!!!!!!
Thank you. Will be a family favourite.A bit messy to prepare but worth it."
1239906,83873,2009-07-13,0,"Excellent fried chicken- very crispy and I love using the soup for dredging.  The chicken was a bit tastless though, so next time I will be sure to add more spices."
82679,151143,2006-01-11,5,"We LOVED this!  My husband had seconds which is ALWAYS the sign that it was tasty!  Even my son- a picky eater ate it!
"
311757,151143,2006-05-12,5,We loved this recipe! The only thing I did different was I cut the peppers into strips and sauteed them rather than actually stuffing the peppers. It's just a preference. 
4601,151143,2006-06-25,5,"This was very good.  I have made stuffed peppers before but they were stuffed with ground meat, rice and veggies...I enjoyed these more.  Adding more meat gave more of a fuller feeling when I was done eating them.  And the cheese adds nice flavor:-)."
331817,151143,2006-07-06,5,These are sooo good!  My husband likes them too and he isn't south- beaching-it!  Very filling and tasty!  Thank you!!
350112,151143,2006-09-08,5,"This is a great recipe!  I did not have the canned tomatos, so substituted fresh diced tomatos and a little canned tomato sauce.  Yummy and pretty to look at."
401101,151143,2007-01-27,5,"My sweetie made these one night, but he used ground beef, and canned spaghetti sauce, which we had on hand.  They were delicious, and a real keeper recipe!  The filling and sauce were VERY tasty!  A bit higher in carbs than I like, but oh-so-worth it!  Thanks for a real WINNER!"
593726,151143,2008-01-03,4,"Very good version of stuffed peppers, I didn't mix cheese into the mix but I think next time I will.  Thanks you!"
95743,151143,2008-03-27,5,"Stuffed peppers don't like me but Dh adores them and constantly pleads for them.  He gives this recipe an A+. more than 5* review.  He particularly liked the fact that it didn't contain any rice, just mostly meat and cheese.  Apparently the meat and cheese made him unconscious of the added vegetables - always a good thing.  Great recipe,Laurie."
813300,151143,2008-04-11,5,"AWESOME and totally filling.  My husband, who is doing SouthBeach kicking and screaming really liked this one."
142335,151143,2008-05-12,5,"Fabulous!!! I was getting really tired of salads. I used ground chicken, added some taco seasoning and a can of spicy rotel tomatoes. Yay, new SBD recipe!"
894352,151143,2008-07-17,5,"Fantastic! I served this to some friends that came for lunch and no one had guessed that it was South Beach ""phase 1"" friendly!"
199953,151143,2008-09-05,4,Quite good!
557801,151143,2008-09-22,4,"This was quite good.  Since we don't really like the strong flavor of the peppers without steaming them a bit first, and since it was only going to be the two of us eating these, I scaled this down and made it as a casserole.  While this was very tasty, I think I still prefer another recipe I have that also includes more vegetables and some brown rice.  I did stir some cooked rice into this, but still missed the additional veggies.  Made for PAC Fall 2008.  Thanks for posting!"
1181369,151143,2009-02-23,4,Really very good - the tenderness of the green pepper was quite nice.  Thanks for a great recipe!
1010158,151143,2009-07-21,5,Very Tasty! I used dried parsley instead and it came out fine. I make this recipe every few weeks or so w/ cooked brown rice added in. Husband and I like very much.
23479,151143,2009-09-12,5,We absolutely loved these stuffed peppers! Made them exactly as the recipe said except I hade no Spike seasoning so I had to improvise. :) We will absolutely be making these again...
1314914,151143,2009-09-24,5,"These were very, very good! I also chopped up some fresh spinach and added it to the veggie mix. I used Penzey's Northwood Fire instead of the Spike. I blanched the peppers first rather than microwaving them. This recipe is so good that it really hides that not so great ground turkey aftertaste. Delicious!"
579298,151143,2009-12-09,5,Absolutely amazing! Already can't wait to make them again :) Perfect as is!
2560944,151143,2012-12-13,4,"Delicious, simple & SB friendly...sans rice."
800077,151143,2009-12-31,5,"This is an excellent recipe!  Added a dash of red pepper flakes and made it with soy crumbles rather than turkey to appease my vegetarian sister.  Easy to make, filling, and delicious.  I suspect it will be even better when I try it with turkey."
280109,151143,2010-01-03,5,I love this recipe!!  Have never been fond of the rice type stuffed peppers...this is perfect!!
119552,151143,2010-01-05,5,Very good!  I only had a can of tomato sauce and used half of it in place of the canned tomatoes.  It turned out very well- will make again.  Thank you!
818109,151143,2010-01-09,5,I added a cup of cooked rice and seriously...this was AMAZING.  I loved it.
735399,151143,2010-01-28,0,I could not have tomatoes because of the acid so I added mushroom soup and it still was very goooood! Thank you for the recipe..
807627,151143,2010-05-27,5,"so yummy!!! I have been trying to stay away from rice and pasta so i made this recipe :) I was worried that my husband might miss the rice, but he told me that he liked it even better without because it is meatier :)"
1011115,151143,2010-09-06,5,"This was so good! I made a few adjustments. I used lean ground beef, chopped up 2 medium sized tomatoes, did about 4 tbl worc.sauce, did garlic powder instead of garlic, omitted the celery and added a tiny bit more salt.  I also added some fiesta blend cheese to the mix before scooping it into the peppers, then topped with more cheese, moz and fiesta blend, so darn yummy!!!! There is only two of us and 4 peppers was too much, next time I will just use 2 and then maybe save the rest of the mix and serve it over rice or I guess you could eat it in a tortilla or with nacho chips? This was yummy!!!"
135887,151143,2010-09-27,2,We didn't care for this at all and we love stuffed peppers.  It was very bland and WATERY.  The water really made it unappetizing.  Sorry we didn't like it.
390859,151143,2010-12-05,0,"I'm not giving this any stars because I did not have Spike seasoning and used a substitute.  It worked out okay but was not great.   The peppers were GREAT however, so I would love to try the recipe as written sometime if I ever find Spike seasoning.   My only other comment is the recipe never says when to add the Worchestershire or the Spike.   I assume they should be added when the turkey if cooking but it should be clarified regardless."
1786772,151143,2011-01-05,5,I altered this recipe by using groud turkey and a tomatoe based cheese sauce instead of the worchestire sauce...it came out FANTASTIC!!!!! Definitely a dinner meal that I will plan to have again.
1333534,151143,2011-01-18,4,"This recipe is easy and very tasty.  I've been making it with ground venison (although I've also made it with the ground turkey) and it comes together quickly and makes a fast, healthy and satisfying dinner.  Following the recipe as written, I usually have some extra filling after stuffing four peppers, but the filling makes great leftovers over rice or on a bun.  Thank you for posting!"
1291672,151143,2011-04-20,5,This recipe was so filling and so good!  I did not use the whole jar of tomatoes and used greek seasoning instead.  Everything was so tasty and a great healthy recipe for the whole family.  Thanks so much!
1395332,151143,2011-07-31,5,Wonderful recipe. Even my toddler devoured it! We added a bit of quinoa instead of brown rice and it had a great flavor with the rest of the dish!
2274657,151143,2012-05-26,4,"First off, I think the recipe needs to be revised because there is information and steps missing. It was not clear what kind of tomatoes to use (fresh? canned?) It tells us to cut the tops off the peppers but it never says to take out the seeds and membranes. And although worchestershire sauce was in the ingredient list the directions never told us when to add it. That being said, overall this was fairly tasty. I would suggest that if you try this recipe that you check your peppers in the microwave before the 5 minutes suggested. Mine were so overcooked by that time they were almost falling apart. Since I don't have Spike I substituted my own combo of herbs and spices and I added a little cheese in the meat mixture instead of putting it all on top. It was certainly fast and filling which is good when you are on SB phase one."
2284424,151143,2012-06-04,5,These are great! I make them all the time now. The kids love them and so does the hubby. Also they are simple to assemble. Thanks!!
2485798,151143,2012-11-06,0,I've noticed that some of these folks added rice to this recipe. Rice is NOT on the list of foods for Phase 1 of the South Beach Diet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
680747,310082,2008-07-29,4,This was great! I made this for dinner on put it on some frozen italian chicken. Thanks for the recipe. ~Chris~
310953,270259,2007-12-26,5,"for a cheater version, use a box mix of brownies, and add the crushed mint oreos with  a sprinkle of crushed candy cane.. YUM"
227586,270259,2008-12-09,4,"This recipe made a very good brownie, which was fudgy, moist and minty!  I did add 1/2 tsp baking soda and since I ended up picking up the wrong chocolate (I used semi-sweet) I had to lower the sugar amount by half.  Turned out great just the same.  Made for photo tag.  Thanks for sharing!"
679953,270259,2009-06-21,5,"Well, the peppermint cookies were an adventure to find, seeing the time of the season.  Luckily  I knew a vendor, that works at the Jewel warehouse 20 minutes from here and he got me a package.  Now as for the recipe, I excluded the candy cane, and the salt.  They were fantastic cookies that will be made again.. near Christmas time here.  Made for 1-2-3 hit wonders."
120264,270259,2010-06-17,5,"These were so nice and chewy and the peppermint flavor took it over the top!  I followed Nora's suggestion and used a brownie mix and it still came out great.  I wish I could give these more stars.  Thanks, Donna"
15521,270259,2010-12-16,5,"I cheated and used the boxed mix version of these brownies, but they turned out fabulously!  I made them to send to school for my daughter's teachers.  I loved how they looked so pretty and festive.  I baked the brownies according to the directions on the box.  Had to bake a few minutes longer, but otherwise didn't make any changes.  Used chopped up mint oreos and crushed candy cane.  YUM!"
198154,270259,2011-06-12,0,"I am going to wait until I make this again to add my stars.  I had bought my mint cookies after the hoidays when they were on sale.  I had started to make these browinie and set my ""helper"" DD on the task of breaking up the cookies while I was making the batter.  She used the regular oreos by mistake so I upped the mint extract to 1/2 teaspoon.  I though they were ok this way, but not as minty as I would have liked.  The kids loved them and DH gave them 4 out of 5.  I guess I will have to wait until holiday time to try to make these again, as no one has these cookies anymore.  But I am looking forward to it and I will add our star rating to the review at that time."
291188,270259,2011-12-19,5,"I was so excited to try this recipe!  I used a boxed Betty Crocker brownie mix because easy and they always come out perfect!  I was sad Trader Joe's was out of peppermint Joe Joe's, we bought a box a couple weeks ago and loved them but they said sell out fast.  I used mint Oreo's which has a light green filling.  I sprinkled crushed candy cane on top, how ever you couldn't see much of it at the end. It was there when I checked  the brownies but after I reset the timer for 5 more min they all sank into the brownie- I was bummed so not many pretty red pieces on mine. However now that I see a few of the candy cane pieces it looks a little funny melted so I might like better not adding? Maybe I should sprinkle very crushed pieces on top after cooked?  The Oreos crushed on top didn't look pretty and were soft Not a crunchy topping so I think next time I wont crush them for the top so it looks prettier, but maybe I didn't like the look of mine because mine were light green filling.  Anyway they taste wonderful and that's what counts.  I really enjoyed them cold out of the fridge more then served at room temp.  Thanks for the fun idea I will make again next Christmas!"
546010,155959,2011-07-17,5,Excellent marinade. We will be using this often. Marinated for 24 hours.
294401,155959,2006-02-27,5,The very Best!! I have tried to put this Marinade together many times! It tastes exactly like one I used to get at a specialty butcher. They called it Chicago Marinade. WOW!!! Thanks!
199848,155959,2006-07-24,5,"Very flavorful and juicy.  I marinated my beef for 20 hours, then brought it to room temp before grilling.  I added a pinch of sugar to the marinade, otherwise made it as written.  We'll be eating this again.  Thanx for sharing."
266591,155959,2006-09-02,5,"I made this today and it was fabulous! I served it with a sauce made of baby bella mushrooms with steak sauce, dry sherry and a touch of brown sugar. Boy was this good!"
207176,155959,2007-05-18,0,I have a similar recipe and it is also used for pork or lamb but it has 1/3 cup lemon juice and uses 1/4 red wine vinegar. Just a variation!
55818,155959,2007-07-07,5,"I didn't change a thing. Very flavorful marinade and the meat stayed sooo juicy. Why would anyone buy a bottled marinade...this took about 2 minutes to throw together. Thanks ""Ant"" Kelly!!"
294705,155959,2007-07-11,5,"This had great flavor, I will be making this again !!"
158086,155959,2007-07-23,5,I made this tonite and it was wonderful....we just fell in love with the marinade....great recipe
195750,155959,2007-08-20,4,"This is the most mild tasting marinade that I have tried so far.  Mixed it according to directions and marinaded my flank steak for about 8 hrs.  The taste was mild, but flavorful.  A great all around marinade that will please everybody.  Thanks for the recipe!"
551658,155959,2007-08-25,5,ALL I CAN SAY OHHHHH MYYYY GOOODD !!!!! I followed this recipe and I let the london broil sit in the marinate over night and the next done I cooked the london broil on a broiler pan and put the london broil in the oven OUTSTANDING DRLICOUS MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH!!!! thank you for a wonderful recipe!( I printed thw recipe and stuck the recipe on the fridge for quick access)
285019,155959,2008-01-25,5,"I made this last night for dinner. I thought I'd have some left-overs for lunch the next day. Boy, was I wrong. My family loved the steak so much, we completely scarfed the whole thing down. What a winning recipe! I love the flavor the balsamic vinegar & garlic gives the steak. I marinated it over night & broiled it to a perfect medium rare. Next time I think I'll grill it. YUM!! Thanks ""ant"" Kelly for a great recipe. ~from another ""ant"" Kelly"
135887,155959,2008-02-25,4,Very good!  We marinated for 24 hours and cooked it on our indoor Hamilton Beach for 8 minutes each side.  Done to perfection and very nice flavor.  Thanks for sharing
49168,155959,2008-02-26,5,This was an awesome marinade recipe!!  I marinated a london broil for 24 hours and threw it on the grill/ med/rare-was absolutely fantastic!!  Thankyou!!
787084,155959,2008-03-10,5,This is an excellent marinade! I loved it! Thank you very much.
377712,155959,2008-05-17,3,"Very tasty marinade; however, after marinading for three days, I expected the london broil to be tender.  It wasn't at all and it  was made it as written."
81284,155959,2008-05-18,5,"Very tasty, and a big hit with our dinner guests.  This is a nice way to make a tougher cut of meat into a very enjoyable and savory meal!"
679759,155959,2008-08-22,5,This marinade is wonderful!  I used it on london broil that I had cubed for kabobs and then we grilled them.  The meat was very flavorful and got rave reviews!
157785,155959,2008-08-28,5,"I let it cook too long, but it was super yummy anyway! I did not have the balsamic vinegar and didn't try a sub for it. Still wonderful!"
68460,155959,2008-09-21,5,"Excellent!  I had quite a plump cut of beef labeled ""London Broil"" and so scored it quite deeply, marinated it and grilled it longer than the stated 5-7 minutes per side.  I seared it over high heat on my gas grill for about 5 minutes per side and then roasted on indirect heat for another 20-30 minutes, until the internal temperature was about 110√Ç¬∞  It was still quite rare in the middle but that's OK with us because we eat the more cooked ends and then I use the leftover middle (rare) part sliced up in a stir-fry the next day.  We routinely do this with beef on the grill....the smoky-tasting grilled rare beef tastes great in a stir fry combined with some chicken, perhaps, or shrimp and whatever veggies are in season.  Thank you KJK#5 for posting this great marinade and directions, especially the camping directions!"
559290,155959,2008-10-03,5,"This marinade makes the most delicious tasting meat my hubby or I have ever had. Far better than any we've had at any restaurant and so easy to make! We like our meat cooked med-rare and it was so juicy and bursting with flavor! I took the little bit of left over meat, sliced it up, heated it in the microwave for about 35 seconds and added it to a romaine salad with tomatoes, cucumber a little mont. jack cheese and balsamic vinaigrette. It was still just as delicious. Thanks so much for the great recipe. I have been serching frantically for this recipe today because I couldn't find my print out. Everyone viewing this recipe, make sure you save this to your cookbook!
*UPDATE* I made this again with a 4.5 lb piece of London Broil 3 weeks ago when my hubby had a ""guy night"" at our home. He told me yesterday they are still talking about it, saying it was the most tender and flavorful meat they've ever had (I marinated it for 3 days in a 13x9 dish, flipping every 12 hours spooning the marinade into the scores on top each time). They were asking when they can come over for it again. Served with garlic parmesean mashed potatoes and grilled corn on the cob. Perfect ""Man Meal"". Thanks again."
47907,155959,2008-10-23,5,I picked this recipe to make for my DH's birthday dinner and we both loved it.  Our grill ran out of gas so I ended up broiling it and the meat came out perfect. I served sauteed mushrooms and onions alongside.   Thank you for posting a keeper!
625629,155959,2008-11-06,5,Very very good.  The whole family loved this and I gave out the recipe!  Thanks so much!
908175,155959,2009-01-13,5,"This was the best London Broil Marinade I have ever made. Just delicious!. I even overcooked the meat a bit, but it didn't get dry or tough. We used leftover steak for steak sandwiches the next day and it tasted so great I didn't wan to cover it up with steak sauce."
169969,155959,2009-02-19,5,London Broil was on sale and I remembered this recipe so I grabbed a slab and headed to Recipezaar! This marinade was wonderful. I ended up marinating the steak for about 36 hours. I would make this again. THanks chef!
362184,155959,2009-02-23,2,"With high hopes, in light of the great reviews, we tried this over the weekend.  Marinated a little longer than specified and it still did not make our london broil tender - or flavorful.  The directions were followed exactly and cooked under the broiler.  We ended up throwing out.  Sorry, this did not work for us at all."
51089,155959,2009-04-19,5,"This is a great marinade! Made with ingredients I always have on hand and the house smells amazing while it's broiling. Thanks, Shwana, for inspiring your ""ant"" to post this recipe!"
311926,155959,2009-05-02,5,This recipe turned out great and I know we will be using it again soon! Thanks for another 'go to' marinade : )
1250930,155959,2009-05-03,5,"I tried this tonight and it turned out fantastic!  The meat was tender, moist, and very flavorful. I will be using this recipe over and over. Thanks ""Ant"" Kelly for sharing this with us all!"
1187622,155959,2009-05-28,5,"I actually made this for a OAMC meal and froze the London Broil in the marinade.  Turned out delicious.   Not an over powering marinade at all, still left the taste of the beef come through.  Think I may try this marinade with a pork loin in the future.    Will definately make again."
1098228,155959,2009-06-03,5,This is a really good marinade.  It's also very simple (which makes it even better).  It gave the meat a great flavor without being overpowering.  Will definitely use this recipe again.  Thanks for posting it.
927058,155959,2009-06-09,5,Wow! This recipe is great! I've never had beef turn out quite as flavorful and tender as it does with this marinade and cooking method. We are low-carb eaters and sometimes we reduce the amount of balsamic vinegar to lower the carbs. Any suggestions on an herb other than Rosemary just for a change? We make this A LOT and I am ready to switch things up a little. Thank you very much for sharing!  :)  Chris
714468,155959,2009-07-07,5,"This recipe was delicious.  The balsamic vinegar gave the meat just a hint of sweetness, which made it oh so good.  This will be the way I make my London Broil from now on."
289117,155959,2009-07-14,4,"The marinade was very tasty, but I found that the cooking time was quite off.  My london broil was just over 2 lbs. I grilled it for 7 minutes on each side, and it still came out rare.  Thanks for the recipe!"
178427,155959,2009-08-08,4,I had the opposite problem from one of the other reviewers. I purchased a top quality Black Angus flank steak that weighed a tad over 2 pounds. I marinated the steak for 24 hours and grilled it for exactly 5 minutes per side. The meat was well done and tough. We did like the marinade so I'm giving it 4 stars. Next time I'll look for a thicker piece of meat and try this again. Thanks for sharing.
1076165,155959,2009-08-11,5,"This is my wife's favorite dish that I make, now.  Thanks for sharing it."
390058,155959,2009-08-14,5,Too bad I can't give this recipe more than 5 stars.  Very easy to prepare and excellent blend of flavors in the meat.  I bought the top round rather than flank steak and it was very tender and juicy.  Will definitely make this again.
868654,155959,2009-08-23,5,Really really delicious tender steaks!  We love this marinade!
524381,155959,2009-09-13,4,"This was pretty good and very easy!  Personally, I didn't care too much for the sweetness of the balsamic vinegar, but that's not a fault with the recipe- just a personal taste.  I'm going to try it again with a bit less vinegar and maybe some more worcestershire."
679834,155959,2009-09-14,5,"Made this in bulk for labor day, cooked it ahead and everyone was scarfing it up.  Shared the recipe with several friends.  Thanks KJK for sharing."
53932,155959,2009-09-20,5,This is so incredibly flavorful!  I don't much care for rosemary so just added a sprig rather than mincing it.  It smelled and tasted wonderful!
857489,155959,2009-09-21,5,"I agree with everyone-delicious marinade! I added chopped shallots and 1 tablespoon brown sugar. 
I added Rosemary Garlic seasoning by Tone's instead of just rosemary.
It was one of the most flavorful marinades for London Broil I have tried and I liked the tip about scoring the meat in a diamond pattern. Thank you so much for sharing your family's recipe.
 I will definitely make it again!"
843660,155959,2009-09-26,5,"We marinated for 4 hours and took it to my boyfriends mothers and grilled, she was very impressed, we all loved it, the combination of spices were wonderful"
1271144,155959,2009-10-29,5,This was amazing my husband and son could not stop eating the broil. Thank you for sharing the recepy. Simple and delicious.
1271914,155959,2010-01-11,5,"This marinade is just perfect. I have tried @ least 5 different marinades before trying this one and I always feel like I have to keep looking for the perfect blend of herbs, spices and flavor. Well, I have stopped looking, this is it for me there is no flavor that overwhelms, it's tastes just the way a steak should taste. I loved it, my picky daughter loved it and I can't wait to make it again. Thank you."
233495,155959,2010-01-26,4,"We tried this on our steak the other night and really enjoyed it.  The rosemary added a nice woodsy flavor, and I liked that there wasn't a sweet ingredient - I tend to like my steaks salty, not sweet.  I think I would cut a little worcestershire out next time, as well as add a little kosher salt.  Thanks for sharing this great, easy marinade - we will definitely be using it again!"
496354,155959,2010-02-22,4,We tried this the other night.  The flavor was great.  I marinated it for about 6 hours - next time I think I'll marinate longer to really let the flavors into the meat.
118268,155959,2010-03-29,5,I can't believe I haven't rated this yet.  It is one of our go to recipes on our camping trips.  I freeze the meat with the marinade and thaw it in the cooler.  Love it!!!  Thanks for sharing!!
520644,155959,2010-04-07,5,Very good.  We will have this again!
696417,155959,2010-06-27,5,holy delicious! i didnt have rosemary so i substituted Thyme. honestly my fave marinade so far! thank you!
173579,155959,2010-09-25,5,This was a tasty little marinade.  Thanks for posting.
1122311,155959,2010-12-11,5,"We liked this. I used lots of thyme, added a few red pepper flakes. Cut beef up small and made into kebabs. Next time i would marinate it longer--I only had about an hour before dinner. Tasty."
1844201,155959,2011-03-03,5,"This is just simply delicious! I have been making this for about a year now and just felt compelled to compliment the chef. I have 3 extremely picky sons, and this is one of the very few things that they will all eat. It all started when the local market had london broil ""BOGO"". I found this recipe, and the rest is history. Thanks for dozens of delicious meals!"
1003492,155959,2011-03-12,5,"AMAZING! I followed the recipe exactly, marinated it over night, and watched everyone lick their plates. I will making this for the rest of my life! Thanks a ton!"
680724,155959,2011-03-31,5,This was fantastic! I let it marinate for 24 hours and then used my oven broiler. My hubby and his brother devoured it! We will try this again soon with our charcoal grill.
1179225,155959,2011-04-10,5,Excellent!
1390917,155959,2011-05-12,5,Incredible marinade! This is exactly what I was looking for in a marinade. I've made it twice for my wife and I and both times it was excellent. Just enough zip and zing and now my mouth is watering like crazy again haha! Thank you for posting!
92886,155959,2011-05-23,5,"This is the only London Broil that I have really liked.  The marinade is just excellent.  I marinated for 24 hours.  I would suggest cooking 5 to 5 1/2 minutes per side.  I did 6 minutes per side and that made it medium, I prefer medium rare.  I sliced up the left over super thin and used for steak sandwiches."
175824,155959,2011-06-11,5,The was wonderful. Made it for my siser yesterday. She said it was delicious. She wanted to know where I got the recipe. I liked the recipe because I had all the ingredients on hand and didn't have to substitute anything. I marinated it for 22 hours then put it on the grill. The marinade made my kitchen and refridgerator smell yummy. This is really a terrific marinade. I plan on trying it on other meats. Thanks for posting.
1956614,155959,2011-07-14,5,"I did not have rosemary.  I put some Mrs. Dash, Cumin and chopped Fresh Cilantro.  I cooked it in my smoker using Pecan wood and cooked it at 275 degrees until the internal temp was 132 degrees basting it when it hit 100 degrees.  I then let it rest for 15 min wrapped it in foil and cooled it down in the ref.  Sliced it thin....My wife loved it and so did.  This is a great simple marinade."
297957,155959,2011-07-27,5,"I made this yesterday and marinated it for 9 hours and it was wonderful! The only thing I changed was to use 1/4 cup of worchershire sauce instead of soy sauce and added McCormicks Montreal Steak Seasoning. We cooked it on the charcoal grill and it was the most tender london broil we've ever had. The flavor was unbelieveable delicious, and I will be using this recipe from now on for beef marinade!"
141654,155959,2011-08-24,3,It was good flavor - but strong.
20238,155959,2011-09-01,5,Delicious! Only change I made was to reverse the measurements of the Worcestershire and soy sauce. Just a matter of personal preference. Marinaded the beef for about 6 hours. Then cooked on the gas grill. Very flavorful and it really does smell yummy.
1968337,155959,2011-09-23,5,Tryed it was 5 Stare/***** Good choice for cheap cut of beef.:) THANKS Ken!
165933,155959,2011-11-12,5,"I marinated this overnight, turning occasionally as suggested.  It gave a wonderful Asian flavor to the beef.  Thanks."
128541,155959,2011-11-24,5,"Delicious marinade, I made this for a family dinner and it was gobbled up!  My only comment is to make certain you slice the meat against the grain and slice it very thin.  I know this is pretty basic advice, but my husband cut ours too thick and it was a bit tough.  Great recipe!"
469786,155959,2012-05-07,5,"Love this. I used a 2.2 lb london broil, marinated 2 hours (perfect), and cooked on the BBQ. when the BBQ hit 500 deg. I put on the meat,  for 7 minutes on both sides.  Awesome.  ty again"
481092,155959,2012-05-13,5,"Fabulous marinade.  Grilled it to  perfection, and even great leftover."
55729,155959,2012-06-11,4,"I really don't know how many times I have made this and forgotten to review it! I love the flavor, and I usually have the ingredients on hand. A keeper!"
383346,155959,2012-06-12,5,This marinade gave a great taste to the steak.  The steaks were tender.  Very yummy.  Thanks KJK :)  Made for I recommend tag game
1810947,155959,2012-07-01,4,"I loved the flavor of this marinade, it really does get down into the meat. My only complaint is that my London Broil was TOUGH!!!! I followed the marinade recipe, took the meat out for 30 mins before broiling it for 5 mins on each side. It looked so pretty coming out of the oven  but  I just had a feeling that it wasn't tender. Sure enough, when I cut it - tough! I even cut it from every side/angle but it didn't get any better. Despite my disappointment, my husband ""chewed thru it"" and ate every bite on his plate. Anybody have any suggestions for next time?"
2077392,155959,2012-08-23,0,Simplly the BEST!!   A new family favorite!!! The flavor is fantastic & leftovers taste great (that is if you have any left overs)!!!
2295544,155959,2012-12-21,5,"I tried this recipe as written and reversing the quantities of the soy sauce and worcestershire sauce, because I thought it sounded odd to have it the way it was written.  But surprisingly enough we all LOVED it as is, and although the reversed way worked, just wasn't as overwhelmingly yummy.  So, recipe is tested and approved as is!  Thanks for sharing... a new family favorite for us!"
2692489,155959,2013-02-13,1,"I wanted to make this so bad until I looked at the nutritional values. I was shocked to see the fat, cholesterol and sodium for this dish. For this reason I can only give it 1 star.   I am sure the taste is 5 stars but health wins out over taste."
713529,155959,2013-06-23,5,"Grilled this tonight after marinating about 6 hours.  So full of flavor and rich tasting.  This is a keeper!  My steak was 3.5 pounds, so I increased all amounts slightly.  I agree with the others, do change the worcestershire sauce 1/4 cup and the soy sauce to 2 tbsps.  Delicious!!"
776436,155959,2013-08-21,5,This was delicious!  We grilled our first london broil this past weekend and used this marinade.  It will be a regular around here from now on.  Thank you KJK #5 and &quot;Ant&quot; Kelly.
191533,155959,2013-10-19,5,"Excellent flavor! I also reversed the amounts for soy and worcestershire sauces. Marinaded for 24 hours and broiled in the oven, 10 min. each side for medium-well done. My london broil wasn&#039;t the best cut, but we still enjoyed it because of this great flavor!"
742029,155959,2013-11-03,5,delicious! we typically grill it over high heat for 6 min per side...perfect medium rare.
758742,155959,2013-11-17,5,This is my &quot;go to&quot; recipe for whenever I find London broil on sale.  The only thing I do differently is to use low-sodium soy sauce.  Perfect every time.
1365025,155959,2013-12-29,4,I followed directions exactly. I marinated for 8 hours. I used my George Forman grill and grilled each side for 5 min. and it came out perfect. I cut it as thin as I could but it still was a little tough but edible. It tasted good also. Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup.
2610542,155959,2013-12-31,5,Awesome marinade!  Followed the recipe to the letter.  Marinated the steak overnight.  It was delicious!  Definitely a keeper.
1689787,155959,2014-01-12,5,Great marinade and my favorite part was that I had everything already in my cupboard to make it!
530146,155959,2014-02-23,0,My family loves this recipe. The meat is tender and the flavor of the marinade is not overpowering. We love it cooked on the grille.  Thanks for posting.
661864,155959,2014-10-25,5,"I&#039;m used to seeing people change nearly everything about a recipe, then saying they didn&#039;t like it. But giving a recipe one star based solely on it&#039;s nutritional values? Just plain silly."
482546,155959,2015-02-10,5,"I doubled the recipe and used low sodium gluten free soy sauce, otherwise it was by the book. I grilled two 3lb. London broils after they marinated over night and they we very tasty and everybody loved the flavor! Will certainly do this again next time we grill LB"
2000276097,155959,2015-06-17,4,"This was very good, the meat was more tender than usual and really flavorful. I&#039;m back to clip it, it&#039;s a keeper! Thanks Ant Kelly!"
2000050594,155959,2016-05-03,5,Possibly the best London Broil marinade I've found.
2001056568,155959,2016-06-20,5,Easy marinade but the five stars are for how our London broil tasted.
2001087944,155959,2016-07-14,5,"Made my very first London broil with this recipe and it was amazing. Warm the night of it was great, but the next day, as sandwich meat or with cheese and crackers cold... I think it was even better!!!! I had a somewhat larger cut so it took more like 8 minutes on each side with the broiler and the rack on the third rung from the top. I also have a meat tenderizer that I used thoroughly on both sides. Came out medium rare in the direct middle and a little more towards medium at the sides, and not at all tough. So delish I am making it again this week. But marinating it for 4 hours instead of 2 and am contemplating using the slow cooker crock pot. Haven't decided if I want to change anything yet."
2001107604,155959,2016-07-29,5,I too don't like it when people change a recipe without trying it first as written. This London Broil is excellent as is. My daughter just moved out on her own and being away at school for 4 years with having everything made didn't want to fall into the take out food trap. So this is the recipe I helped her make. She loved how easy and tasty it is. She said she will be making it again. Thank you for a great marinade.
2000391889,155959,2017-01-11,5,"Wow, what a fantastic marinade! I marinated this for 24 hours, did not change any of the ingredients. My cuts of meat were a little thick, so it took longer than the 5-5 1/2 minutes another reviewer said to broil each side for to achieve medium rare. I'd go with ~7 minutes in the future. What the directions don't tell you (us first-timers) to look for on your finished piece of meat is for the outside to have a nice dark brown/char on it if you are cooking in an oven. It should certainly look like the pictures people have posted when done. This turned out nice and tender. The diamond cuts are more like an &quot;X&quot; pattern on both sides of the meat. My boyfriend and I loved this!! It's definitely going to be made again. Thanks"
2001239018,155959,2017-02-01,3,This was just OK. I found the worchestershire sauce to be too pronounced. I used fresh rosemary and could not detect it in the final product. I would probably move on to another recipe.
2000782488,155959,2017-02-11,5,"Like many others I love the marinade and the flavor of the beef. I used flank steak. Probably could have cooked it a few minutes longer, but I can't say enough about it. Like another reviewer I cut up and heated a briefly in the microwave to toss in a romaine and kale mix salad. Used poppyseed dressing and there in some pumpkin seeds, or chopped almonds. A few dried cherries or cranberries was especially tasty. This will be a standard favorite for me."
1800198751,155959,2017-03-14,5,"I used this marinade for London broil. It was delicious, ingredients are ones you typically have on hand, and it only has to marinate for several hours."
2001508074,155959,2017-04-26,0,I'm trying this tonight. My London broil is marinating as we speak. I had all of the ingredients on hand and together it smells so good. I'll lyk how it turns out.
2001550271,155959,2017-05-23,0,Question?can. this be cooked in the oven or croc pot?
2001552977,155959,2017-05-25,4,Recipe was great. only thing I changed was time needed. Needed almost 12 mins per side to be med rare. Still delicious. Just wish I had timed accordingly.
2001559906,155959,2017-05-29,4,Excellent marinade for those bargain London Broils on sale this time of year.
2001599120,155959,2017-06-25,0,"This marinade is great. After marinating the beef for about 4 hours I browned both sides being careful to not burn the balsamic on the outside of the beef. I then cooked it in a pressure cooker for an hour with 18 oz. of Brown Ale, a sprig of rosemary, package of onion soup mix, and 2 tbs. of condensed beef bullion. Once done I thinly sliced the beef and put it on some country french bread being sure to get plenty of juices then topped with carmelized onions and shreded mozerella chesse. Placed that under the broiler until the cheese melted and topped with some creamy horseradish sauce. Best hot dip roast beef sandwich I have ever had."
2001397221,155959,2017-07-02,5,This is now my favorite marinate. My husband loved the London broil
2001517344,155959,2017-07-02,5,"Absolutely devine!! My father called me a few weeks ago and asked &quot;how the hell am I supposed to cook this british steak you brought me?&quot; I smiled, took a sip of my adult libations, and replied, &quot;should I cook you dinner tonight?&quot; I admittedly 'winged' the marinade, using a plethora of random condiments containing vinegar that i could find in the fridge. It was okay- it's steak! He suggested (in the flat-out dad type manner) that I cook it again for dinner. I figured his tastebuds, so damaged from 30+ years in a trona mine, wouldn't know the difference if I used an actual marinade recipe. fast-forward to dinner time. Margaritas, daquiris, and dinner on the deck. Glorious potatoes, gorgeous beef, and anxious old me- just certian he'll have some dad-like critique to feed me. &quot;This isn't the same as last time,&quot; he says, Pausing beefly to lick the leftovers from his moustache. &quot;No, it's not...&quot; before I could add that I'd tried something else, he smiles a wry little twisted grin, and says, &quot;this is even better. New favorite.&quot; Instantly inserted in the recipe book! (; thanks Kelly, from pops and I both!"
2001608304,155959,2017-07-04,0,"I agree with many cooks that you review the recipe the way the user posted it. If you have a different way, post your version under your own thread. I want to read reviews of the recipe as written..... that being my soapbox moment, ant's London broil is delish! I made the marinade as written.... I'm not a rosemary fan but this is great. I marinated overnight in zip lock bags..there were 2 steaks..... 5 mins a side.... I was worried the marinade might burn but there again... perfection.... you get this wonderful crust and if course the time depends on thickness of your steaks... I tend more towards rare and this was wonderful. The flavors are spot on. Cold leftovers made great steak sandwiches. Great recipe just the way it is!!!!!"
2001616505,155959,2017-07-07,5,Best London broil ever. So simple and delicious. I grow rosemary in my herb garden which really tastes so good fresh picked.
1955371,155959,2017-09-12,5,"Finally found a recipe that made me like London Broil! After numerous prior attempts, resulting in tasteless tough meats this time we loved it. Was ready to never try again, till now. Marinated for 24 hrs and then reverse seared it on Primo ceramic grill. Will increase garlic next time, otherwise fantastic!"
2001747291,155959,2017-10-10,5,"I am being sarcastic here as I also believe if one changes a recipe they should refrain from rating the original recipie. My Sarcasm: Great recipe. I did make a few changes for the better! My entire family is VEGAN, so I substituted as follows: Eggplant for the meat. Malt vinegar for the balsamic. No fat organic sour cream for the olive oil. Habanero sauce for the worstershire. Nutmeg for rosemary. I cooked all in my pressure cooker for 30 minutes on high. We all loved it!! It's just that we thought it was kind of mushy, too spicy. None of my dogs would go near it?? THIS IS MY NEW GO TO MEAL! IF I ever make it again."
2001745266,155959,2017-10-31,4,Delicious! Would have given 5 stars but I think it should be marinated longer than the recipe suggests.
2001939101,155959,2018-01-18,0,Tried this recipe tonight and it turned out well. I normally cook chunks of meat in a crock pot until they fall apart but wanted to try a prepare more like a steak. I followed the recipe and it was very good. My adult son who does not like any steak like type of meat tried and he liked it also. I will use the recipe again but will try with Tamari sauce instead of soy since my sons GF cannot eat gluten. I cooked a bit to long for my desire temp but it was at 120 and a minute or so later it was at 145 so next time I will try to take off before this. We prefer rare. Thanks
2002101559,155959,2018-04-08,5,"Terrific marinade!!! I use it with my sous vide setup at 138F for about 8 hours, then sear each side for about a minute in a cast iron skillet. I do add some brown sugar to assist in forming a good crust, but otherwise this is perfect! And the sous vide makes it soooooo tender. This is my go-to Sunday dinner entree!"
2002114314,155959,2018-04-15,5,"I've made this several times, and it never disappoints! I've marinated as little as 2-3 hours and as much as 24, and it's delicious every time. My grill is broken, so I make it on a grill pan on the stove top, 6 min per side on medium-high. Thank you for this amazing marinade!!"
2002143392,155959,2018-05-06,5,My entire life I had refused to eat london broil due to it being a sub par cut of meat...that was until my wife tried this marinate. We have it bi weekly now. Thank you!!!
2002209704,155959,2018-07-06,5,"I had been missing the great London Broils I enjoyed at the home of my friends and neighbors the Picards in Mohegan Lake, NY before I moved to Maryland ten years ago. I finally decided to try it myself. This recioe is THE BOMB. Awesome! Easy to do and perfect results. I appreciate the tip on cooking time. Thank you so much."
2002230031,155959,2018-07-26,5,I tried this recipe as written last week and it was a HIT. My family loves it. The only change was I placed the roast on my George Forman Grill for about 8 minutes. Let it rest for 10 minutes and it was perfect. This recipe is a keeper!
2002255370,155959,2018-08-23,0,This looks awesome! Just put the London broil in the marinade. Looking forward to eating it tonight!
2002266553,155959,2018-09-04,5,I followed the directions step by step and it turned out perfect.
4470,212188,2010-06-09,5,"Love a ""clean the fridge"" soup.  Mine differed slightly but I followed your suggestion for beef stock etc.  I added leftover chicken, corn, 1/2 cooked potato, blackbeans, Onion, garlic, carrots and a bit of zucchini. For seasoning I used some Italian, pepper and ""Spice Depot Hot & Spicy"" - Great tasting soup. 6 servings and the fridge is empty of bits and pieces"
21752,22123,2002-04-10,5,"Well, I certainly DID feel like cooking last night, and this recipe was just what I was looking for!  I made my own mushroom sauce since I didn't want to add any dairy to the meal.  I also made up a cornbread mix because that stuff isn't available in my corner of the world.  I was totally stressed out yesterday, need to do some cooking, and also needed some kind of comfort food for the family.  Even my picky eaters had a helping!  I upped the quantities to feed 6, and my only complaint is that there wasn't enough left over to bring in for lunch today.  Diamonds4heather, this really fit the bill, thanks so much for posting this recipe!"
38168,22123,2002-04-16,5,"Another success story.  This is fabulous recipe that is fast and delicious.  The husband and kids loved this one too!  The cornbread is a big hit with the kids, it's crunchy and kinda of sweet, a perfect combination.  Thank you diamonds4heather for another wonderful receipe."
41539,22123,2002-05-23,4,"Mercy, what a top notch mixture of tastes and textures.  I found this very filling and not too much work.  I came home last night dead on my feet but that doesn't stop the little monsters from screaming for dinner.  This slipped into the oven rapidly and everyone was pleased.  I think I will make this for the ladies bridge group meeting at my house next month.  Thanks for posting this winner!"
28649,22123,2002-07-17,5,"This was great!!  I put it all together when I got home from work in no time.  There were no leftovers to have today.  I used peas when I made this, next time I'll try broccoli.  This really reminded me of a potpie.  So simple to make and quick."
27643,22123,2002-08-02,5,"This is just so quick and easy to make! It's a great mixture of flavors. My husband declared ""we'll make this one a regular""! I used ground turkey and frozen mixed vegetables. Added a spinach salad and dinner was done! Thanks, Heather, this is one that will get a lot of use!!"
372791,22123,2008-11-04,3,I don't know how I felt about this casserole.  We ended up throwing a lot of it out.  I made my own cornbread and used a different cream soup because nobody in my house likes mushrooms . . . I don't know there was something off about the taste for us but to each their own.  Sorry.
570804,302399,2009-09-14,5,"I made these several months ago and forgot to rate them.   Very good and so tasty right out of the oven.  I did substitute tex mex cheese (shredded) because that is what I had, but looking forward to trying other variations."
383853,302399,2009-09-22,5,"Really good buiscuit recipe.  I liked the garlic salt :)  I was going to use all mozzarella cheese, but realized I had a little bit of cheddar that needed to be used up, so I used some cheddar too.  I served this along side of some chili.  Made for Pick A Chef Fall 2009."
305531,302399,2013-02-15,5,Yum! These were so simple and so good. I can see switching up the seasonings and cheese depending what you're going to serve these with. Thanks for the easy keeper. Made for Cookbook Tag.
96295,166089,2006-05-08,2,"We thought it tasted gritty and the peanut butter was too dominate...not impressed with this one.
"
377039,166089,2008-04-14,1,"I made this tonight.  We had pizza.

It tasted (and looked) like chicken with peanut butter smeared on it... sorry but it just didn't work for us, we couldn't eat it. I made no changes to the recipe."
237533,166089,2008-06-01,1,"I found this recipe elsewhere too and made a batch of various dump chickens. Wish I'd seen the reviews here! The smell while it was cooking was not pleasant. No sauce either. As Jeanna said, it was like peanut butter smeared on. Couldn't taste the other flavors at all. It was also visually unappealing."
153623,166089,2009-09-29,1,I found this on another site as well.  It looked nasty.  Once we scraped the pastey sauce off the flavor was okay but not great.  The kids woulddn't touch it.  I will not repeat.
334750,166089,2011-01-18,1,I made several dump recipes recently and this was the first one we tried.  I so wish I would have found this review earlier.  We ate the chicken and it was nothing to brag about.  I wont be making this again.  You couldnt event taste any of the other flavors.  Too bad I was excited about this recipe.
1997304,166089,2011-09-02,0,This is by far the worst chicken recipe I have ever tasted. I ended up throwing it out!! Don't waste your time trying it out! Just imagine Dried out chicken with peanut butter on it! that's it!!!!
357071,166089,2013-04-07,5,I thought this was great. my hubby likes peanut butter on ham so why not chicken . This was very good. Thanks
95743,112984,2005-11-07,0,"I really expected to like this more but the squash tasted watery and ""thinned"" out the spaghetti sauce flavor.  I microwaved the squash so perhaps that was the problem."
133842,107229,2007-06-12,5,"These were great!!!! I made this recipe for PAC spring 2007. I brought some to work, I told my mom to come by and pick some up for dinner, she did and her company loved them. I didn't have cilantro at the time but I really like it and will make sure to use it nex time, This dish is great Hot or Cold. Thanks Reed!!!

130663,353171,2009-11-12,4,Loved it and will make again trying different fruits.
315565,353171,2009-12-21,4,This made a lovely dessert . I had to cook mine lots longerand that is I think due to my choice of fruits. I used a mango and it was so juicy that it affected cooking time - but it tasted just great. I will try with berries next time. I love the fact that the variations are endless so Loula -thank you so much.
463435,353171,2010-03-18,5,"I really loved the simplicity of this dish and found it to be a true comfort type dessert. Not to sweet, which is a plus. I topped mine with dried cherries which sank to the bottom of the pudding, and then I added slivered almonds.  The combination of the two went so well together. I will definitely make this again. Made and reviewed for the Feb.-March./Special Event 2010 Potluck Tag Game."
163112,353171,2011-01-04,5,Oh yeah!  This is called clafoutis in other places like my house.  ;)  I used frozen/thawed/drained cherries with complete success.  It cooked up perfectly in the time frame given at 350F.  I love this recipe......it's all gone.  Made for Veggie Swap 1/11.  xo Bethie
11297,353171,2011-07-12,4,I loved this served with dollops of whipped cream on a cold winters day.  I made mine with drained canned pears and slivered almonds which worked well.  I will be making this again using other fruits when in season.  Made for Aus/NZ swap June 2011
1016189,353171,2012-05-06,4,"This was super easy and quick -except for the baking time of course. I used a blender to mix the batter, poured it into the pan, and topped it with fresh blackberries. This was very good as is, but next time I make this I will add some vanilla and either add more sugar, use brown sugar instead of regular sugar, or a combo of both sugars to make it a bit sweeter and have more depth -me and my mom thought it needed these changes, but my dad and brother both thought it was fine. I wish I had taken a picture before cutting it because it turned out very pretty. Also make sure you put this in the oven while it is still warming up, as part of the cook time, because if you don't you will need to turn down the oven temp at the end to get the custard to set (I baked mine for 15 minutes longer than called for and then turned it down to 300*F for 7.5 minutes)."
73836,60938,2003-08-19,5,"These were really very,very good.  I did not fry the potato skins, however, I chose to shake them in a plastic bag with a little olive oil and seasonings, and then baked them at 230*C for about 20 minutes,until crispy,then added the toppings.  I also used low fat cheddar and instead of sour cream for dipping, I used low fat ranch dressing.  Overall a winner!!!"
951974,325714,2008-09-24,5,I'm new here but just had to write to say that this recipe is my all time favorite carrot cake.  I've been making it for years and years.  I think I found the recipe in a vegetarian cookbook but I too get rave reviews every time I make it (which hasn't been for a while) - thanks for reminding me about it.
27443,271594,2008-03-22,0,This was WOW. The men in the house gobbled it up til the pot was empty. I served it with dollops of sour cream. Thanks for sharing.
424680,271594,2011-10-27,5,"Well, I'll admit to a couple of substitutions ~ I substituted a 2nd can of pinto beans for the jalapeno beans, & used a small can of mild green chilies AND a can of plain ol' diced tomatoes in place of the extra hot tomatoes stuff! Still, the soup was wonderful & satisfying for us, & I had several 2-serving portions that I was able to freeze for later enjoyment! [Made & reviewed for one of my adoptees in this fall's round of Pick A Chef]"
10678,24701,2002-04-18,2,I don't think there was enough flavor in this soup. I sprinkled it with soy parmesan cheese and that really helped. I will try it again with a stronger vegetarian broth and maybe would not blend it next time because it is not appealling looking when it is blended.
92796,24701,2006-09-03,2,This is an easy & healthy recipe but doesn't really have a lot of flavor.  I might try it again but would have to add a few additions to perk it up.  I've had similar style soups that I loved so I'm a bit disappointed with the way this turned out.
60992,63986,2003-06-19,5,I made this for dinner tonight and the chops were tasty and fork tender! If you are salt sensitive (I am not) I would cut back on the salt and look for low sodium soup. I couldn't resist adding a half cup of white wine and thicken the juices. This was excellent served with rice and chive buttered fresh carrots. For a simple meal that is hardy this is just the ticket!
95743,63986,2004-08-06,5,"A big hit with the meat-and-potatoes guy in the house.  Served the chops with mashed potatoes.  Be sure you don't overcook the chops if yours aren't 1"" thick.  Thanks, Chuck."
37471,63986,2004-10-02,5,Wow....great crockpot recipe!!  The chops were very tasty and so tender!  Many thanks!
92641,63986,2004-10-13,5,"This was excellent. I bought chops that were just over an inch thick and let them cook for a solid 8 hours. The sauce made from the meat and soup was delicious served over couscous. I served this with Roosie's Zucotte (#96811) and we had a great meal.  The meat fell right off the bones, it was so tender and juicy. Everyone here enjoyed this dish very much - thank you for sharing!"
4470,63986,2004-10-30,5,"I didn't realize that this was a crock pot recipe until I was getting started on planning dinner only a couple of hours to go so I made it in a fry pan- reduced the recipe to 1 chop, used the whole tin of soup, 1 1/2 tsp mustard and the full garlic. Browned the chop, poured in the soup mixture and cooked it at 2 element level for the full 2 hours. Perfect and the aroma in the house was wonderfull. I added some broccoli & peppers last 10 minutes, served with steamed carrots Wonderful dinner thanks Chuck"
28649,63986,2004-11-27,4,The pork chops were very tender and tasty.  I was very impressed at how good they tasted.  I will be making these again.  Thanks Chuck.
170780,63986,2004-12-03,5,"A new family favorite - thanks - this is soooo easy.  I also missed that it was crockpot, but with the advance browning, had enough time to cook on high for 3 hours- turned out great!"
233839,63986,2006-04-29,5,"This was really good.  I used 3 boneless porkchops and cooked the whole thing in a covered electric skillet for 1 hour, and the meat was tender.  Served it with brown rice, and the gravy over the rice was just like what my grandmother cooked! Yumm!"
250238,63986,2006-07-19,4,"Yummy pork chops.  Even the fussy husband enjoyed them.  I used reduced salt soup and served it over rice.  Easy, quick and tasty....how can you go wrong. "
276502,63986,2006-09-06,5,I have made this recipe for many years. My family loves it.
201581,63986,2007-04-18,5,"I used 4 boneless chops and the full measure of soup and seasonings. I stirred in a package of Express Rice (the kind that microwaves in 90 seconds) for the last 30 minutes of cooking. Delicious, and the leftovers were even better! Made for Alphabet Soup Game."
75497,63986,2007-06-20,5,"Very good!  This is so similar to one of my favorite chicken recipes (Recipe #204668) that I can't believe I didnt' think to try it with pork chops myself.  I served this with wild rice and steamed veggies.  I just eyeballed the seasoning amounts, so I'm sure I used more than called for on some.  Thank you for posting... it was delicious!"
592866,63986,2007-09-20,5,Excellent! A friend gave me this recipe years ago.  One of my favorites.
252816,63986,2008-01-24,5,"We just ate these for dinner this evening,with spicy roasted green beans and cheesy corn muffins..I made 4 chops otherwise followed the recipe...When the chops were fork tender, I added 1/3 cup chicken broth and 1/3 cup long grain raw rice.And fresh ground black pepper over the chops...The flavor was wonderful and the chops were so tender..My DH said to make more rice next time so I will use 1 cup of broth and rice next time..I will be making this often.Thank U for this great recipe.."
371738,63986,2008-09-17,5,"I used 6 boneless chops on the high setting for 3.5 hours.  The family loved it.  Truly an easy, tasty, ""set-it-and-forget-it"" recipe.  Thanks, Chuck!"
1541726,63986,2010-02-03,0,"as a young married woman i made back in 1970, i made this recipe for the two of us..now we are empty nesters, still working lotsa hours and it is STILL great!!!"
475397,63986,2010-05-01,5,Love this recipe... easy and the pork chops fall apart!! Added sliced carrots to the bottom of the crock pot and served over mashed potatoes.  I  also added more dry mustard and ground pepper to the flour mixture.
451605,63986,2012-02-17,5,"THANK YOU!! This recipe is to die for! MANY years ago I came across this recipe (for my crockpot) and prepared it frequently as it was such a hit. A thousand moves later & with recipes lost, I've been searching for this exact recipe!! It's on the menu tonight & I can hardly wait!!"
2838993,63986,2018-07-29,0,"One of the best old crockpot recipes! I always layer the browned/floured and seasoned chops with thinly sliced potatoes and onions. Also, you can substitute the soup with any kind of chicken broth and a little leftover cooked rice can be thrown in if you have it. This is delicious on a cold wintry day."
804931,67888,2009-03-06,5,"Ribs are a favorite of mine and this looked so good with the two sauces.  This is an excellent rib recipe and the sauces are awesome!  It does take awhile to make the sauces and measure everything out, but the end result is so worth it!  If you like ribs and want something different to make try these!  They are sure to please your taste buds!"
53932,219681,2007-03-31,5,"I've had a fair number of Lupo's spiedies and this recipe is pretty darn close.  I prefer a little more oregano and a little less basil personally, but that's just me.  I basted mine to add even more flavor.  Good job, Dr Nick!"
39197,219681,2007-04-21,5,"very close indead,made your recipe but added some crushed rosmary. these can also be made with pork or lamb if making with lamb, usually add some mint for flavoring also. originally they were made with lamb. if your ever in binhamton ny area in early august come visit the balloon and spiedie fest !"
868860,219681,2008-06-21,0,"I have a half gallon jug of Lupo's spiedie marinade in my pantry. I have it shipped to my current residence in Florida from my home town of Endicott, N.Y. where the spiedie was introduced to the tri-cities area. This is truly a regional favorite. The annual ""spiedie cookoff"" in Binghamton is laughable. Take the original spiedie and turn it into any shishkabob contraption imaginable.
Lupo's uses apple cider vinegar - not distilled - and corn oil not olive - quite a different taste. Lamb is the original meat for a spiedie - cut in approx. one inch pieces, marinated for twenty four hours then put on metal skewers and cooked over a very hot charcoal grill - approx. four inches over the white hot coals. Chicken and beef were introduced in the nineteen seventies. Original spiedies are served on a single slice of fresh Italian bread and doused with a squirt of fresh marinade."
85309,219681,2008-11-30,5,"My wife and I were born and raised in the Binghamton area and grew up eating spiedies. I've dabbled with trying to replicate the recipe for years. Your effort is close enough to to warrent a 5 rating, but is still missing a little something. Wish I knew what it was. Thanks for the keeper. Will use this recipe many times in the future and try to tweek to fill in that missing piece. (Used apple cider vinegar on our second effort and it seemed to get us a little closer).  Will let you know if we find it. Thanks for reigniting this quest."
37302,219681,2009-07-29,0,"This isn't actually a review, but more of a comment.  I notice that there is no mint in this recipe-the other recipe I have has some mint.  Could that be what MTDavids feels is missing?"
1213915,219681,2009-12-12,5,Excellent recipe--just like the real thing (I lived in Binghamton for 9 years)!  Be sure to use the vegetable oil and apple cider vinegar.
182358,219681,2010-10-23,0,"So glad to find this recipe and will be trying it this afternoon with a few changes.<br/><br/>For future reference, the ingredients list from the Lupo's Spiedie Marinade bottle are:   corn oil, cider vinegar, salt, spices, garlic, paprika, hydrolyzed corn protein, sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate as preservatives, xanthum gum, calcium disodium EDTA to protect freshness, soy bean oil."
1722000,219681,2010-11-05,5,"Grew up in Endicott and Lupo's was where to get spiedies.  I've bought the marinade bottled before, but the fresh version using this recipe totally trumps that!  None of those added preservatives to muck it up.  The smell alone brought me back to Main Street pulling into that sweet little drive-in spot and the best part is I made mine with lamb which is rarely available anymore.  Long live Lupo's and Roma's bakery that makes THE most perfect bread to put these delectable pieces of meat on!"
1789080,219681,2011-04-10,5,"GREAT RECEIPE!!!  As close as you can get.  Growing up in Binghamton, moving west and missing the flovors.   I add a little ketchup, about a tablespoon,  friend is a butcher who said this adds to the flavor, he is so right.  Apple cider vinegar and corn oil I use also.  Miss the bread, something about Roma's."
2143285,219681,2012-01-11,0,"My parents are both from Upstate NY. Elmira, and Johnson City. My mother's parents lived in JC until they passed. Needless to say, we love spiedies! My sister and I love them. But we live down south now. No spiedies here. My dad can tell you, there is no spiedie like Lupos. And yes, Roma's will always be the best bread to put it on. I will be trying this recipe very soon. I also emailed it to my dad as soon as I stumbled upon it. Lupos is the only real deal for him, and I know he's happy you posted this! I can't wait to try it! I'll be marinating the chicken tonight! Thank you so much!"
2928116,219681,2013-08-02,0,"Hi guys,&lt;br/&gt;Great!&lt;br/&gt;The missing component is ** Grape Leaves"
1802516775,219681,2014-02-22,4,I love chicken spedies but for an alternative of cooking on the grill my family and I when camping crock pot it for 4-7 hours on low and it still is very delicious. Maybe you&#039;d like to try it sometime.
1072593,219681,2015-03-31,5,"ymmmmm...yes, yes!  OH.  Through the corner of your eye did you see me chasing &#039;chicken spiedie&#039; happiness?"
2000780531,219681,2015-12-27,5,"Excellent recipe!!!

Changed it a little. Used canola oil in place of olive oil. I doubled the recipe so i used 3 large lemons and one lime. I used 2 tablespoons on the heaping side of Italian seasoning. I used the same amount of salt ( kosher ). I used a tsp.of black pepper. Instead of a half cup of white vinegar I used 3/4 of a cup and I marinated for two days then grilled. Unbelievably tender and tasty."
2001498878,219681,2017-04-20,5,"I grew up very close to binghamton, this recipe is amazing, the only difference was I added some crushed red peppers to give it a nice kick!"
2001631282,219681,2017-07-17,0,"Yep Endicott originated Spiedies. I grew up there and Lupo's Char Pit was the place to go. They didn't even use chicken when I lived there. Lamb is the best but pork is a close second. The west coast doesn't have a rival to Spiedies. Second most important part is the Italian bread you serve it on. Roma's Bakery had the best thin sliced Italian bread. Still can't find it's equivalent out here. Ummm, can't wait, making my own Spiedies tonight."
2001356199,219681,2017-11-19,5,Wonderful! The only thing I do differently (actually 2 things) is I use boneless skinless thighs and marinate for 48-72 hours. Thanks for posting.
65056,61973,2005-04-06,5,"Healthy, healthy, healthy and pretty good to boot!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for the omission of the vanilla (I'm out), and I actually chose to make this as a loaf rather than muffins, which worked quite well.  Not too heavy, with a surprisingly light crumb.  The carrots and raisins add nice flavor and its just sweet enough.  I could have stood for a bit more spicing or another flavor, but for what this is (a simple, straightforward, healthy, fiber-full bread) its great."
133174,61973,2005-05-07,5,"These are nice and healthy.  I used 1/3 cup sorghum syrup instead of the brown sugar.  DH is a diabetic and the sorghum adds nutrients and has less of an effect on his blood sugar.  The amount of cinnamon was increased to 1 teaspoon and I added 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg.  Because of the moisture from the carrots, I reduced the oil to 2 tablespoons and used canola because that is what is in the pantry.  These sat over night and were served at room temperature.  I will be putting the remainder in the freezer so that I can have bran muffins later.  I like this recipe because it only makes 12 which is the perfect batch for a small family."
317696,61973,2008-01-12,5,The only thing I did differently was to increase the cinnamon to 1 tsp.  This is the perfect healthy muffin to go with your morning coffee.
1773,190,2001-01-29,3,this was okay.  too greasy for my tastes.
7961,190,2001-05-14,0,"My only comment would be that it looks is if I should have kept out the 1st patch of  meat cooked and used the remainder to simmer for 2 hours because if I used all the meat I did not have anything to bring to a boil it was to dry.
just my thoughts."
10649,190,2001-12-11,3,"I agree with gay. Also too many ingredients makes a dish too complictated, I would say a few of the spices could have been left out. It had a nice flavour though!"
177567,190,2005-08-23,5,We enjoyed this so much!!!  Did not find it greasy as we used the lean meat...we did add about 5 cups of tomatoe juice so it was jucier.  Loved the combination of spices!!
39835,255916,2009-08-13,5,"Delish and so easy to put together in the morning before work! Instead of the red pepper I used a jalapeno, diced and only 1 pound of ground beef. Great end-of-the-week supper! Thanks for sharing!"
738401,225707,2011-12-04,5,"Excellent!  I've been planning to make this recipe since 2008 when I printed it out.  I made half a recipe today without the mushrooms and used the tomatoes instead of beets but also added cooked chicken.  The dressing is so perfect.  I may have added too much honey because I didn't measure it but it turned out so thick, fragrant and fabulous!  Definitely I will use this again.  Thanks for posting such a tasty recipe."
104295,32169,2005-01-23,5,"This was excellent!  I used canned tomatoes because the ones in the stores this time of year are pretty awful.  Therefore I did not add the 1/8 cup water because of the extra liquid in canned tomatoes.  I also left off the hot sauce (my kids won't eat it) and used Italian seasoning in place of the different herbs.  Oh, and I used 1/2 cooked turkey breast (1/2 cup) and 1/2 cooked canadian bacon.  Served over whole wheat spirals it was fabulous.  This is a wonderful way to use up some leftover cooked meats.  Something I'll cook again.  Thanks!  "
4470,32169,2005-03-09,5,"Just what I was looking for! I had some left over chicken  that already has a bit of lemon Garlic flavor & decided that it could meld into this recipe- It tango'd, it rhumba'd and it did the Salsa all with perfect timing and in good taste. I used 2 tbsp Denzil's Kamakazi hot sauce. Served over linguine with a small green side salad This is a flavorful easy recipe that  will stay in my favorite pasta recipes - Thanks Sackville Girl glad you didn't have all the ingredients for the other recipe"
29063,32169,2005-03-14,5,This was really wonderful! Full of flavor and veggies and perfect for my Fiance who loves it Hot :) We enjoyed this a great deal served over whole-wheat pasta and it made plenty of food. Thanks!
311625,32169,2010-01-16,5,"Everyone inhaled this! I used a large can of diced tomatoes (they aren't great in Michigan in January!), omitted the mushrooms, and cut the Tabasco in half to make it more kid friendly. Used a whole pound of rotini. Thanks Sackville!"
140132,269909,2008-06-25,5,"Oh boy, this is very good bread.  I used my own pumpkin that I froze after halloween last year and it was great.  Moist and flavorful.  I made this to use with recipe #35812 and I'm so glad I did because I've found a new favorite. Thank you for posting."
27783,26835,2002-12-28,5,"Delicious pound cake!  I made this with the intention of using it as a base for other desserts calling for sliced pound cake, but this can stand on its own witha bit of powdered sugar dusted on top. I had no problems preparing this cake.  It makes a large cake and is very versatile - you can vary the flavor slightly by using a different flavor of yogurt.  I used vanilla this time.  It is easy to prepare and turned out great.  It is dense yet tastes light. Thanks! "
175574,26835,2005-01-07,5,This is the 'perfect' Pound Cake! I love the flavor with the vanilla yogurt and am looking forward to try it with another yogurt flavor!  It's a keeper!
57222,26835,2005-10-10,4,"This is really good - dense, firm and flavourful! I used ""forest berries"" yogurt that I needed to use up, and can't wait to serve this to people and play the ""guess that flavour"" game. ;-) Used only 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 cups of sugar as at that point I ran out... Great cake, thanks for the recipe!"
309847,26835,2006-04-14,3,"More like a buttery yellow cake than a pound cake.  Overall it was good, just not as dense as I would have preferred.  Will keep searching for the perfect poundcake!"
86318,26835,2006-04-29,5,"I love this cake! I cut the recipe in half and made the cake in a 5 1/8 cup loaf pan. I used plain yogurt and 3/4 teaspoon each orange oil and orange blossom water, omitting the lemon zest and vanilla. It's fantastic, though for the size pan, next time I think I'll increase the batter by about 1/5. Thank you very much for posting this easy delicious recipe."
552715,26835,2007-08-05,5,"WOW!  I can't believe not everyone liked this.  I thought this was delicious, as did my family.  It was so good, that I volunteered to bring a dessert to a BBQ so that I could make it again.  I sliced strawberries and topped it with whipped cream.  I almost wished I had skipped dinner so that I could eat more of this.  YUMMY!!!"
858246,26835,2008-07-21,0,This is a great easy cake.  It was delicious with strawberries or plain.
1186786,26835,2009-02-28,4,"This cake is very tasty and easy to make,but I agree with Lola #3 that it is not as dense as pound cake usually is.Any recommendations?"
1369303,26835,2009-08-30,0,"I made this cake for my grandsons first birthday...it was the base for a Finding Nemo Aquarium cake, with all the fish and extras. The cake tastes delicious, was easy to make, hoever, mine was brown like spice cake. Noone can tell me why, but IM making it again, to see how this one turns out"
1488888,26835,2009-12-19,5,"I made this cake for my son's first birthday, shaped like a little stuffed horse (his favorite). :) 
It was very easy to make, and I put it into 2 loaf pans. I can see why people say it's not as dense as a regular pound cake - it seemed to me like a pound cake/white cake hybrid. I got an almost unnoticeable flour taste in mine, which could mean I used too much flour or needed to use cake flour. I also used orange zest instead of lemon, vanilla yogurt, and a little bit of almond extract along with the vanilla extract. YUM!
Definitely going to make this one again!"
111477,26835,2012-04-10,5,"Fantastically easy recipe and it came out perfect! The cake was so good, it was gone before I had time to take a picture! I am definitely making this again. The only change I made was to exchange 1/4 cup of flour with cornstarch. I had read that a little cornstarch helps produce a more tender cake. I think this addition worked out well, as the cake was more smooth and velvety than other pound cakes I had made with all AP Flour. Cake flour apparently gives the same result but I don't have access to cake flour where I live."
2001838661,26835,2017-12-07,0,OMG!!! Just took 2 loaves out of the oven. Couldn't wait for them to cool so I had to have a slice!! I used Yoplait strawberry banana yogurt and it is so good. I usually buy store bought cake but as of late I'm into baking from scratch. It makes me feel cozy (winter time) Will be making again for sure.
771469,261296,2009-01-28,5,"We try to have one meatless dinner each week.  This recipe is a keeper for a tasty, healthy, low-fat and low-point meal.
The kitchen smells wonderful while the breaded eggplant is baking.  
I used plain breadcrumbs instead of Fiber One crumbs, low-fat mozzarella instead of fat-free and regular parmesan cheese instead of reduced-fat."
639634,261296,2010-02-27,5,"This was fabulous!  I would rename is ""Eggplant Lasagna"" if I could.  I used the whole egg instead of just the whites.  I used the heels of my homemade bread for the breadcrumbs, and I used regular fat cheeses.  I did find that 1 cup of sauce was not enough.  I used a whole jar of sauce total.  It was awesome!!  The breaded eggplant with the garlic and all smelled amazing cooking in the oven before I layered it.  My 3 and 4 year olds ate it up!  We will for sure do this again!"
408454,276594,2009-10-30,3,"We found these OK and will use again when we find out what is missing for our tastes.

Thanks for posting a good recipe."
126003,83133,2004-12-01,5,"I really liked this recipe.  It was very easy and good!  I used beef riblets which are meaty and easy to eat.  Thanks, Rick B (2)"
180463,83133,2004-12-14,5,I made these ribs using country style pork ribs. It was my first attempt at making ribs and they were great!  I could't believe how tender and flavorful they were.  I will definetly be using this recipe again and again.
181850,83133,2005-02-27,3,"I like quite a bit more flavor. I added hot pepper sauce, 1 tbs., cut the brown sugar to 2 tbs., and used tomato paste instead of ketchup (sugar)."
153067,83133,2005-03-03,5,"I loved the flavor of this recipe.  I browned my ribs (well, not mine, but..) and did the rest as followed.  I used country style pork ribs.  The part I wasn't thrilled with was that they all fell off the bone.  Now, I'm not complaining here, because I figure it was less messy since I could eat it with a fork, no knife required, they were so tender!  I will definately be making these again!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  LA"
258757,83133,2005-11-05,5,this is a great recipe for when you just dont feel like bbqing... or in my case a rainy day like it was today... I used baby backs and my guests said they were my best ribs yet
53959,83133,2005-12-22,5,These were soooo good. I used Beef Ribs as I was already making a Pork Rib recipe (Maple Glazed Ribs Recipe #140139) and followed the directions exactly. This is a definate keeper and I will be making them again soon. Thank you for posting this recipe to help me satisfy my BBQ cravings. 
142997,83133,2007-01-27,5,"I have been the Mr. Mom for 15 yrs. (as well as working) and this is a dish my wife and two children never huff at.  It's fun and easy, great tasting, and aromatic to boot.  I've made this at least 6 times and always a hit.  Great with or over buttered noodles."
6512,83133,2007-05-23,5,"These beef ribs were finger licking good!!! Instead of cooking on top of the stove, after sauteing the onions I poured everything into a caserole dish and baked covered in a 325 degree oven for 2 hours and they were quite tender and tasty. Thanks!!!!"
1265522,83133,2009-07-01,5,"Very delicious! My husband is a meat eater and absolutley loved them! I added my own little touch: I added cilantro, onions sliced in rings (not minced as the recipe calls for) and I added about 3 tablespoons of Valentino hot sauce to contradict the sweetness a little. Paula Dean is a genious!"
140132,83133,2009-07-11,4,I made this using beef short ribs and they made the house smell wonderful while cooking.  I will make these again as they make the ribs very tender.  Thank you for sharing this with us.
196038,83133,2009-07-28,5,"Had guests for dinner and everyone finished this up and liked it alot. I did make the mistake of burning (not browning) the onions, so started over with a new pan, added a little oil, beef bouillon , onions to be browned for the second try, and went on from there. Thanks for sharing! Loved it! This goes into the 'favorites catagory'!!"
1002265,83133,2010-06-01,5,"This was SOOO good.  I only had one packet of realemon juice (from CiCi's pizza, lol) and no worsteshire sauce.  I used a T soy sauce instead.  Also my ribs were partly frozen when I started and they came out PERFECT.  I cooked these in a cast iron skillet with two layers of foil covering it.  Served with Kohlrabi Slaw and 40 minute buns made into breadsticks instead of buns (both recipes on here).  Perfect Summer meal.
Wonderful recipe, thanks!"
592481,83133,2011-03-18,4,"I made pulled pork with it, tossing all the ingredients in the crock pot and letting it simmer on low for about 4 hrs.  It was a bit dry for pulled pork, so I added some extra sauce.  Very tasty (especially the lemon flavor), but I agree it could have used a bit more zing.  I doubled the worcester sauce and omitted the salt.  Thanks for posting!   (Paul Paul--thanks for the idea of serving it over buttered noodles!)"
43083,83133,2011-04-03,4,These were tasty! I made them 100% in the crockpot and it worked out quite well. Very tender. The sauce kind of disappeared but I served with additional BBQ sauce poured over them. Enjoyed by all. Thanks.
2000874331,83133,2016-04-09,5,I made this recipe 2 times. Once with regular  store bought BBQ sauce and the other time with all ingredients as listed in therror recipe.  Both were great. The one with store bought BBQ sauce tasted better to me because it&#039;s what I am used to but the original recipe is great too. So give it a try the only thing I did different was keep adding water so that the meat would cook long enough and be very tender.  Great recipe.
37449,125195,2005-06-16,5,Yummy for a nice quick lunch! I halved the recipe and it made plenty! Thanks!
110506,125195,2005-06-19,4,"This was really good, but a bit salty for our taste. I think next time I will cut the seasoning salt by half. I also omitted the celery because we don't like it.Otherwise, it was very good and I will make it again."
185105,125195,2005-06-21,5,"Kelly, once again you've done it!  Absolutely wonderful, and just what I've been looking for!  Sometimes I swear you just post recipes for ME!!!  Perfectly seasoned, in my opinion, and something that reminds me of my childhood...Thank you so much for posting this easy and tasty recipe!  (Oh, I used mild cheddar cheese, but I thought I might like sharp cheddar better - what kind do you use?)  Stacy  :)"
25731,125195,2005-07-06,4,"I was looking for a replacement for my brocolli salad that everyone requests. Sometimes I like to make something besides my usual. This was very easy and quick to make, and quite tasty. I used shredded cheddar instead of chunks, just for ease, and it turned out very well. Thanks. I'm sure I'll make it again."
221221,125195,2005-07-10,4,You hit the nail on the head with this recipe. It is always requested when family get together. Only thing different was I used two slices of low fat Amer cheese cut up. And low fat mayo. thank you
9579,125195,2005-07-19,5,"This was very tasty! I used canned peas, shredded chedder and no relish because that was what I had on hand. Just added a little more sugar and it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe."
230115,125195,2005-08-05,5,"DELISH!  I love pea salad, and this one is tops.  Didn't have relish so used small amount of apple cider vinegar...can't wait to eat the leftovers from last night's dinner!  Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe, Kelly!"
20754,125195,2005-08-29,5,This was delicious!  Never ever thought of using peas in a cold salad before.  I did use sharp chedder and it was great.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe peacefulnightdove
18652,125195,2005-11-05,5,this was a good recipe we loved it thanks
173579,125195,2006-05-19,5,This was very good.  Everyone in my family loved this salad.  Thanks for posting.  
107135,125195,2006-06-18,5,this is a nice salad to include on a buffet or family dinner thanks for posting dee
102058,125195,2006-07-02,5,"How wonderful to find a salad that is a huge change from the regular lettuce or coleslaw based ones. I used English Cheddar and for the pickle used ""Heinz Tangy Sandwich Pickle"" which DH's cousin had bought over from the UK on a recent visit. YUM, this was such a different taste, and on a luncheon buffet table for 9 guests and family I noticed that I wasn't the only one going back for more LOL. I can see myself making this often for guests as it definiately got the thumbs up this time. Please se my rating system... a wonderful 5 stars :) Thanks !
"
47510,125195,2006-07-11,5,I love peas in a salad and this has quickly become one of my favorites.  Wonderful flavors and easy to prepare.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!
52607,125195,2006-07-22,5,"So funny finding this recipe,I have been craving pea salad.Saw pea salad at the deli in the market,was going to buy,but had a second thought,as I didn't know what could be lurking in their salad.
Came home and found your recipe.Yum!
I cut the recipe down for 2,by eye balling it.
I didn't have sweet relish,so I used hot dog relish,which took care of the sweet relish and the mustard. I used extra sharp chedder cheese.I didn't add the sugar,as the peas were very sweet.I didn't add the seasoning salt, (but wish I could have), hubby is on a salt free diet.
Thanks for the recipe! :0)"
22655,125195,2007-04-07,2,"I am on the fence about this one. It was okay, but not good enough for me to make again. I had it for Easter with about 30 guests and there was plenty left. It didn't go over as well as I expected. I most likely will not make again."
95810,125195,2007-04-08,5,We really liked this salad.  Even my son who says he doesn't like peas ate this.  I used a 16 oz. bag of frozen peas as that is what I had on hand.  The dressing was very creamy and the sesoning was perfect.  Thanks for another keeper!
95217,125195,2007-04-10,4,I made this for Easter dinner.  We really liked it.
99438,125195,2007-04-19,4,"My son (14years) made this for his contribution to our Easter dinner.  He left out the sweet pickle relish because none of us like it and I wasn't about to buy some or visit a fast food joint to get some packets. He used dijon mustard because that's what we have in the house. Everyone except my son loved it.  I might reduce the amount of sauce a bit next time though or maybe make it with half mayo and half yogurt or sour cream.  It would make a nice Christmassy dish with a bit of red pepper diced up in it!
FYI - TRIED THE SOUR CREAM IDEA AND IT ISN'T AS GOOD AS JUST MAYO."
394604,125195,2007-06-17,4,"This is everything a pea salad should be.  Very tasty, crunchy, just plain good.  I made it yesterday, let it sit in the frig over night, and it was great today at dinner.  Mr. even liked it.  Had it with baked beans and crockpot baked whole chicken.  Too hot here to use the oven, this was a great side dish for summertime meals.  Easy to put together.  I will make it again.  Thanks."
68717,125195,2007-08-17,4,"Kroger salad bar has peas, celery, hard-boiled egg, red onions and shredded cheddar cheese. Makes putting this salad together a snap!"
402057,125195,2007-11-23,5,"I am not a fan of peas, they are pretty much the only veggie I won't eat. But I saw this recipe and remembered how fond the rest of my family is of them and decided to make it for my salad I had to bring to Thanksgiving.   As I don't eat peas, I can't tell you if I liked it, but EVERYONE else raved!  There were several requests for the recipe.  Definitely something I will be making again and again. I also  used Sharp Cheddar Cheese.   Thank you for posting!"
275710,125195,2011-01-02,4,"This is very good - and simple to make several hours ahead of serving time.  I made a couple of minor tweaks (used green onion, subbed half a cup of reduced fat sour cream in place of mayo, and chopped a kosher dill pickle in place of the sweet relish which I did not have on hand).  I also increased the sugar to 2 tsp. since I omitted the relish.  <br/><br/>The mustard gives a nice ""zip"".  Would also be good with bacon or water chestnuts added, but fine without.  A def. keeper!"
296809,125195,2007-11-29,5,"A truly yummy & classic pea salad, Kelly! We are having our annual ""Post-Thanksgiving & Pre-Christmas"" dinner party tomorrow nite. I chose your recipe because I love pea salad + I wanted a make-ahead salad that rated to be even better on dy 2 & would introduce a veggie element as my menu does not include a veggie side-dish. I used red onion for a color variant (& I favor them), used shredded cheddar as we cannot get block cheddar here & added only fresh-snipped chives. I am a happy camper & I expect my guests will be too. Thx for sharing this recipe w/us. :-)"
49542,125195,2007-12-01,4,"This is a great alternative to lettuce salad.  I can get tired of too many of them.  Very tasty, easy to put together and even better as leftovers.  Thanks!"
326787,125195,2007-12-29,5,"We have our traditional ""Pea Salad"" every Thanksgiving and Christmas without fail, and I love to make it all during the year. I've used my old stand by recipe for many years and it's good, but I'm always open to trying new recipes for anything I like. When I saw this recipe I had to pass it on to my sister since she would be making it for Christmas dinner. Boy, I'm I glad I did, it's just wonderful. I was curious how the combination of frozen peas, mustard and sweet relish would taste since we have always used canned peas and dill pickles, but I loved the flavor combination. I don't know if she used mayo or Miracle Whip, since I think she normally uses Mircle Whip, but whatever she used worked for me. This is a winner in my book, thanks for a great recipe. Glad to give it 5 stars."
361931,125195,2008-03-23,5,Yum!!!  Need I say more?!  Made this for Easter and it was yummy!!!  Made just as directed!
488244,125195,2008-03-26,5,"Just the way I make it, but I add crumbled up bacon too.  Very yummy!"
324062,125195,2008-04-13,5,"Fantastic recipe.  I used lowfat mayo and shredded sharp cheddar cheese and it was fantastic!  I would only recommend that you use just 1 egg...unless you're a big ""egg fan"". :)

A++"
494068,125195,2008-04-27,5,"I made this salad to go to a Pot Luck dinner and it was excellent!  Everyone around me that had some commented on how good it was!  It was one of the first dishes to disappear on the table, so that says something right there!  This will be made often in the coming hot summer months at my house. We loved it!"
142364,125195,2008-04-29,5,"I was looking for a good pea salad recipe and this is it!  Very easy and so good!  One thing to remember is to read the recipe, I put shredded cheese in mine the first time, it was too fine.  The small cubed as the recipe calls for is much better!  Thanks for sharing!"
590105,125195,2008-06-20,4,Very easy and very tasty!  Didn't change a thing.  Thanks!  Reviewed for ZWT4.
425677,125195,2008-06-23,5,"Okay... to be honest, my Canadian friend and her boyfriend came over and I let her pick the menu off of Zaar in the Canadian ZWT cookbook.  She picked this and I had my doubts, but it was really good!  I will be making this way more this summer.  Thanks for posting!  Made for ZWT 4."
522099,125195,2008-06-30,5,"I like trying different versions of a favorite salad.  I skipped the sweet relish as we don't care for it, and used red onion and colby-jack cheese.  I like the egg in this, which my recipe doesn't have (until now! lol).  Fresh and creamy and a yummy side dish for any lunch or dinner."
309422,125195,2008-08-14,4,This is a very good pea salad.  The only things I did different were to add about 1/2 the seasoning salt that the recipe called for and used dill relish instead of sweet.  It turned out well.  Great summer side dish!
912977,125195,2008-08-18,4,"This disappeared FAST at our church pot-luck!  I cahnged the mayo to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup sour cream. I also used Sharp cheddar, about 4 to 6 oz. and no celery or mustard."
282678,125195,2008-09-05,5,"This is reeeeeelly good! I thought I had celery but didn't, so I diced up a large can of water chestnuts for the crunch factor. I also put a few shakes of celery seed for the flavor.  I will be keeping this one for sure. Thanks Kelly! :)"
386849,125195,2009-02-12,5,Everyone loved this salad.  Thanks so much!
1047882,125195,2009-06-27,5,This salad was quick and easy to make! I had it for a Bible study one night and since then I have had several people ask me for the recipe. Thanks I will be making this again!
457829,125195,2009-08-16,5,this was the best pea salad i have ever had the perfect amount of spice flavors really taste great togetherthanks for sharing
1179773,125195,2009-08-18,5,"Yummy!! When my husband (who hates peas) went back for seconds, I knew this recipe was a keeper. I served this at a wedding shower recently and doubled the recipe. It was a huge hit! I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!"
755277,125195,2009-11-12,5,A great pea salad! Thanks for sharing!
280698,125195,2010-06-14,5,"I followed the EXTRA creamy version & the whole family really enjoyed it!  Well seasoned & nice texture with just the right crunch from the celery.  I made the day before with great results.  A wonderful, warm weather side dish!"
171084,125195,2011-03-22,5,"I think I found my favorite pea salad recipe now!!!   I made a couple of mistakes but easily corrected them.  I cut back on my onion (I thought it was going to be too hot for this salad), then added more.  My celery was substituted with sliced water chestnuts and I used shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  It was very, very good!  Upon my serving it the 2nd day, I realized I had forgotten the mustard and seasoning salt.  Added those 2 ingredients and WOW!!  This is a forgiving recipe and one that I will make (correctly) again and again.  Thank you for sharing!!"
837451,125195,2011-04-11,5,Living in Georgia I love cold salads in Spring/Summer. Next time I may add ham chunks or bacon. Really enjoyed this! Thanks Kelly!
60260,125195,2011-05-02,5,"LOVED this recipe, in fact can't wait to eat some leftovers for lunch today!  Made the recipe ""as is"" using green onions because that is what I had on hand.  While eating dinner I realized that I forgot to put the cheese in it - it honestly doesn't need it so probably won't use it the next time.  Thanks for sharing!"
1329782,125195,2011-05-31,5,"Very nice summer salad. The only thing I did different was a bit less mayo for me. I used sharp cheddar and it was very very good.<br/><br/>I did garnish with 3 slices of the egg after I took the pic, but that was just for the party. The salad was a hit. Very nice salad. I have just enough left for a little light lunch today which is plenty."
768626,125195,2011-06-11,0,"This salad is delish!  I could not use celery and onion, had to use celery salt and onion powder for texture reasons but this salad was a great treat for my family.  First time I prepared it I went to heavy on the cheese (chunks to big) so second time omitted the cheese.  After those experiments I know now I will shred the cheese for us.  Personal preference and has nothing to do with the quality and flavor of this great recipe.  What a great side for a dinner or lunch that is a sandwich or piece of whatever type of protein!  Thank you and God bless.  Laurel"
762694,125195,2011-12-18,5,This is really yummy and easy to throw together.  I added soybeans in it as well and so good!!
174991,125195,2012-02-25,5,Great salad that is now in my Summer rotation.  Nice and creamy.  I'll also try it with ham chunks or chicken the next time.
1579905,125195,2012-02-29,5,Great stuff - I love peas.
839492,125195,2013-02-28,5,"Hubby loves 7 layer salad, I had everything on hand except the lettuce. So, I decided to try this. I thought we had pickle relish,  but didn't. I had some sweet & hot pickles, chopped them fine in place of the relish. Added some crisp pancetta, otherwise followed the recipe. He LOVED this, if I'm lucky, I'll get to taste it tomorrow, but he may eat it all before then! Thanks for sharing, I'm pretty confident we'll be making this one again!"
2000079518,125195,2015-03-22,5,"Absolutely awesome. I tasted it right after it was finished and I wasn&#039;t very impressed. All I could taste was Miracle Whip (which I used in place of mayonnaise). But the next day after a night sitting in the fridge it was wonderful! Great make ahead meal. The changes I made were: Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise, and omitting the celery. Thanks for a great holiday meal addition!"
268272,125195,2018-04-09,5,Simply delicious! Thank you for sharing a wonderful recipe.
146284,347252,2011-08-06,5,"This is fabulous. Every time I serve it to company I am asked for the recipe.  I make it lower calorie, and lower carb by using low fat and sugar free ingredients, and it is still delicious.  Also, to serve as a dip for vegetables, I sub Greek yogurt for the buttermilk.  Leftovers are easily thinned with a little milk to use on a salad.  Without a doubt this is our new favourite dressing"
725505,311991,2008-07-06,5,"mmm... the smell made my mouth water.  i browned beef expecting to make tacos for dinner, then to my dismay, we were out of seasoning!  i quickly found this recipe and was so happy to see i had everything on hand.  also not too bad if you're on weight watchers!  i had one serving, it was only SIX points.  serve with a salad, carrots and water and it's a great quick meal :)!!  kudos!"
534442,311991,2012-09-20,5,This was delicious and so easy to make. It was a little sweet for me but everyone else in my family liked it that way. I would recommend tasting the sauce before adding the brown sugar if you don't like it too sweet. I'll definitely being making this again.
357358,242830,2007-08-01,4,"These pork chops turned out flavorful and tender. Discovered that fennel does not agree with me so I can't honestly say I liked/loved it but DH did. Would love to try this again, minus the fennel and wine, with one cup of broth. Thanks for sharing."
23728,17265,2002-11-04,0,"To use fresh pumpkin: Split the pumpkin in half,  remove seeds and stringy matter with a stiff spoon or scoup.  Roast pumpkin (skin side up on a dark baking sheet) in a 350 degree oven for 50 minutes or until tender,  has little or no moisture and is just starting to caramelize around the edges.  It will slightly fragrant  but not overpowering.

After it cools cut it into strips and skin it with a sharp knife then followed the recipe instructions from there."
44372,17265,2002-11-14,5,"What a delicious pie!  I roasted the pumpkin as stated, but just scooped it out with a spoon (easier that way).  The prep was a little involved, but WAY worth it!  The texture of this pie is a little softer than the pumpkin pie I am used to, it's lighter, almost like a torte.  I served it with fresh sweetened whipped cream.  YUM!  The spice amounts are absolutely perfect!  I wouldn't change a thing!  I will be making this for the holidays this year-Thanks for a great recipe, Steve!"
8688,17265,2002-11-28,5,"$25 Pumpkin Pie?  I'll give you $30!  What a perfectly delicious ending to our Thanksgiving dinner!  Thanks for this recipe, Steve!"
78808,17265,2003-09-30,5,"Incredible!!  I have made several different pumpkin pies in this past year, and this one leaves them all in the dust.  This was absolutely delicious!!  Next time I will start with fresh pumpkin and I can't wait to taste the results!  I made this with the perfect Classic Pie Crust #26205 -- what a winning combination!  Thank you so very much Steve for this scrumptious pumpkin pie recipe.  Dianne"
86627,17265,2003-11-28,5,"Steve - This was a terrific pie! Not too sweet, not too spicy and the taste of pumpkin still came through. Whipped cream - Cool Whip - is there a difference?? Thanks for convincing me to make this one!  It is a winner!"
74736,17265,2003-12-04,4,"This was a very good pie, not too sweet, not too spicy. But to be completely honest it didn't taste a whole lot different from our less involved pumpkin pies. Still very good though, a bit softer than the norm."
170158,17265,2004-10-29,5,I am an avid pumpkin pie maker. The October experience always yields me at least a dozen. This recipe was a gorgeous change. With a homemade crust this is a pie worthy of the highest rank and stature. Omit not one step and you'll be pleased.
95697,17265,2004-11-18,4,"Very nice pie.  At first, I was concerned that I hadn't baked it long enough because it was very soft.  But then I read the reviews here and found out that mine was on par with everyone else's.  My only problem was that I burnt the crust with the prebaking plus regular baking time.  And still my crust wasn't crispy.  I think next time I will skip the prebaking step.  Thanks for a great recipe."
95743,17265,2004-11-26,5,"This is FAR superior to my normal method for making pumpkin pie. I'll admit to using my own filling recipe ingredients but I made my pies with the technique outlined here. The crust becomes and stays flaky and the filling is lighter and airier than most. A winning combination and the ONLY way I will make pumpkin pies in the future.

13063,17265,2004-11-26,5,"This is definately my new go-to pumpkin pie recipe.  Good, mellow, full pumpkin flavour, nicely rounded out by the spices.  I liked the fact that this had a creamier mouthfeel than the typical pie- thanks very much!"
174951,17265,2004-11-29,4,"Wonderful slightly spicy taste.  Not to sweet.
A lot of work though.  
P.S. the crust is wonderful"
225027,17265,2005-10-15,5,"This is a recipe I've always hoped to find, and never even knew it.  The filling has a very pleasant, creamy, consistent texture.  I love the flavor.  It makes a nice full pie. Quite photogenic with cracked, slightly puffed up edges.  The prep actually seemed simple, and the bake time is wonderfully short.  I skipped the food processer and used a whisk -- worked fine.  Also replaced that delicious sounding heavy cream/milk mixture with a can of evap.  Great recipe. Thank you. "
208902,17265,2005-11-29,5,"I'm studying abroad in Iceland and I made this for a Thanksgiving dinner the American students hosted. All the Americans was homesick for pumpkin pie, but now EVERYONE says they can't live without it, thanks to this recipe!"
25455,17265,2006-11-03,5,"This is a wonderful pumpkin pie.  Well worth $25!  I loved the ease of preparation, although I did seem to get a dishwasher full of dishes dirty.  I wasn't paying attention and didn't put crust back in oven for 2nd baking before I put in filling.  It wasn't bad, but it could have used those few extra minutes.  The egg wash and short baking time after filling really does prevent the pie from having a soggy bottom crust.  A definite keeper!  Update:  Made two pies this time..didn't line crust and use bean/rice..just cooked crusts until they were completely baked.  Immediately brushed with egg white wash.  Poured in filling and baked with crust shield.  Couldn't have been better.  Even those who didn't think they liked pumpkin pie loved this.  "
171904,17265,2006-11-24,5,So glad I made 2! It was a little extra work compared to my old faithful but worth it. Most of the first pie is all gone and was awesome for Day After Thanksgiving breakfast. There are only 3 of us and our picky 11 year old won't go near pumpkin pie so now you know where it all went! I had to make a few changes though. I used canned pumpkin and refridgerated pie crust. (sorry!) I have always prebaked my crusts a little even with fruit pies and I would have done it here even if not in the instructions.Thanx for a true keeper!
224921,17265,2006-11-27,4,"This was a really nice tasting pie.  The only difficulties I had was not knowing when to add the brown sugar, since the directions do not specify.  It made the most sense to me to add the brown sugar to the pumpkin, spices and salt in step 5, so I added it there.  I'm glad I had all the ingredients pre-measured (as you suggested) otherwise I would have missed adding the sugar altogether.  The filling didn't seem to set completely, which may have been a result of covering the entire pie with aluminum foil while it was baking (which I opted to use because I don't have a crust shield). Your method of baking the pie shell for fifteen minutes really helps maintain a perfectly flaky bottom crust!  I will definately buy a crust shield and continue using this method in the future."
394077,17265,2006-12-23,3,"Sorry to give this a bad review since I had such high hope for this recipe. But,  the flavor and texture were average. It wasn't worth the effort."
400708,17265,2006-12-31,5,"When I found this recipe was worried about all the steps (this is my first attempt at any pie) But it wasn't that hard once I started and it turned out PERFECT.  The best compliment I got was when my Mom stated it tasted ""Just Like Grandma's Pumpkin Pie"".  I was so proud and will make this my one and only recipe for pumpkin pie.  The texture, taste, and appearance made the perfect pumpkin pie, well worth the $25.  Thanks for posting!"
391611,17265,2007-10-05,5,Best pumpkin pie anfter my own Christmas party last year ended up making this 2-3 times a week for a pregnant friend who's craving could only be tamed by this recipe as i tried others and she wasnt fooled but has turned into a family favorite My husband talks about year round
146284,17265,2007-10-08,0,"I cannot rate this recipe because I used a tried and true filling that my family loves, but I followed the directions for baking the pastry, and assembling the filling, and the results were stellar. I will use this method of painting the crust with egg white, and precooking the filling with any baked pie that has a custard base from now on.
Thank you for the inspiration, and the very clear instructions Steve."
201584,17265,2007-11-23,5,"I made this for Thanksgiving and along with this pumpkin pie, several were brought in and we compared.  Honestly, I am glad I made it and tried the crust technique but for the amount of work and all else, I will buy instead of making.  Five Stars for your well written recipe, a fail-proof pie.  Five Stars for making it happen and having all the ingredients.  I leave it up to zaar folks to decide to homebake or buy."
309939,17265,2007-12-09,5,"This pie was absolutely incredible!  I made it for five Australian people who had never eaten pumpkin pie before and were a little hesitant.  Needless to say, we were all completely won over! They're definitely worth $25."
645907,17265,2008-01-24,3,The crust was nice and crispy. The filling is more custard like than regular pumpkin pie but very tasty. I little more work but worth trying!
231054,17265,2008-11-24,5,"I love this pie!!!  It's a little more work than most pumpkin pies, but well worth it.  I've made it several times and have never been disappointed -- and neither have  any of the guests that were lucky enough to have a piece of it!!!!  Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe."
973916,17265,2009-11-23,4,"This was really good! I decided to test this recipe out to see if I wanted to make it for Thanksgiving, and I am absolutely using it for the upcoming holiday. I used pure canned pumpkin and used almond milk place of regular milk. The baking time was perfect! I like a ""spicy"" pumpkin pie, so I might increase the spices a little to taste, but otherwise this is a fantastic recipe. I will be serving it with home made whipped cream too :]"
369525,17265,2009-11-27,5,"Nothing short of AMAZING! Was afraid to try a new recipe for Thanksgiving. So I made both this, and the standby Libby's recipe. This one blew the old one out of the park! I cant really say what it was that made it better. It was just over the top better. Creamier I think, and just had more of a depth of flavor. I think the brown sugar did it? Whatever it was, it was awesome! Only problem I had was the crust sticking. But that was cause I used a glass pie tin, and didnt grease it first. I also liked that it made more than can fit in a normal 9 inch pie pan. So it was perfect for my deep dish pie pan. Made a nice thick pie.
I will never make any other pumpkin pie!"
1387849,17265,2010-08-31,5,"I looked for years for the recipe and crust technique that my grand mom used, especially , fresh from the pumpkin, from scratch!  Thanks so very much, Steve, for reviving a 'lost' recipe for our family to continue to rave over!  Perfect!"
866963,17265,2010-10-14,4,The amount of effort put into the crust portion of the recipe was not really worth it but the filling was very good.  I made it as written except for the omission of cloves as I just don't care for them. The cook time for me was way off as it took mine almost an hour to bake before the filling baked enough that the center was only a little jiggly. I used a deep dish Pampered Chef stone pie plate so that might have affected the bake time.
1008996,17265,2010-11-27,4,"The texture was perfect.  Deliciously creamy!  My family thought the pie had a little too much ginger, so we will probably play with the spices a little bit.  Thank you for the recipe!"
1802754160,17265,2016-12-03,0,"The recipe doesn't explain the time to add the sugar. So I added it to the pumpkin after it was thickened and then added the milk and cream, etc. Steve G, did your your German Granny give you the spice gouge? It tastes just like the best Gingerbread Boys you'll ever eat--should!"
170891,81185,2004-11-16,5,"This is a great idea! It's delicious and it really stretches out the guacamole. I've made it twice so far, the first time i used some chopped canned tomatoes, and the second time I used bottled salsa for the tomatoes. Left out the cilantro both times (though the salsa does contain cilantro...) Easy to make and really good with corn chips!"
744340,81185,2008-02-17,5,"I make a dish like this except I leave out the cilantro and add cumin and crushed red pepper, and sometimes hot pepper sauce (cholula, tapatio or valencia are all good).  Thanks for sharing."
707249,81185,2008-04-28,5,"I just made this with one avocado, halved the salt and  omitted the cilantro. It is wonderful! I will be taking to my women's Bible study tonight with fat free home made oven baked tortilla chips.  It's sure to be a hit!"
581224,81185,2008-05-06,4,"I really liked this.  My dh thought it was good, but said you could really taste the peas.  I used 2 avocados and skipped the cilantro (personal preference).  This might not compare to regular guacamole, but for a low fat dish it was really good."
2935562,501028,2013-08-07,5,"We tried this chili tonight, and it was FANTASTIC! Not too spicy, not too mild. Although the addition of chocolate to the recipe sounds odd at first, I must say that it adds that little &quot;something&quot; that you didn&#039;t even know was missing! I would highly recommend this recipe!"
1800119725,501028,2013-10-26,0,We tried it last weekend and it the entire family loved it!  Spicy but not too spicy.  It is the best chili I&#039;ve ever tried.  Great Crock Pot recipe and the house smelled great while cooking!  Awesome!  In the process of cooking our second batch to take to a Halloween party tonight.
930462,235173,2008-08-21,5,"This recipe is found in the July/Aug 07 issue of Vegetarian Times.  The flavor is excellent, and even my husband, who doesn't like veggie burgers, loves these.  Definitely make them with freshly cooked rice (they'll hold together better) and with instant masa harina flour instead of the cornmeal (they don't crumble as much).  Very yummy though, and definitely worth trying."
143318,235173,2011-04-14,4,"Spicy hot! Dare to serve these to anyone who says veggie burgers are boring! I used several chopped chipotles and topped with pepper jack...YUM! I love that these don't include beans (I like beans but do they have to be in every veggie burger?) My only reason for not giving them five stars is that they fell apart a bit -- the sticky brown rice and refrigeration helped, but they still weren't firm enough to cook on a grill. These were so good that I wouldn't want to lose pieces of them in the coals!"
199848,140855,2009-05-06,5,"I agree that this is a great alternative to the traditional taco salads.  The tuna gives a whole different flavor.  I used 1 hass avocado for the dressing and it was thick and wonderful.  I chose to use lime juice over the lemon juice, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  I think this would also be great meatless with some beans, or even leftover chicken or steak.  Thanx for a wonderful Mexican salad!"
237951,140855,2009-07-20,5,"DH and I enjoyed this different way to use tuna for lunch.  It was quick, easy, delicious, and quite filling.  Particularly  enjoyed the avocado dressing.  Thanks for posting."
58038,37073,2003-08-27,4,These look just like french fries and are very easy to make.  A lot of options with the seasoning too.  2 Tbsp of margarine doesn't sound like enough but it is plenty.  2 yo DS loved these french fries and gobbled them up.  Thanks for the recipe.
169969,37073,2005-11-15,5,Everyone enjoyed these and I loved that they were so easy to clean up after than fried potatoes. I will make my fries like this more often. Thanks Dancer!
197023,37073,2005-12-03,5,"A fabulous low calorie, low fat way of enjoying ‚Äúfried‚Äù chips!  Very easy to make, very clear instructions, very quick and together with ellie_‚Äôs Spinach With Sesame Seed Recipe #138862, they made a totally delicious lunch.  The weather had turned suddenly much cooler today, and I felt like some sort of comfort food, so I made just a quarter portion, which in step 9 I sprinkled with dried oregano and sage.  Thanks Dancer^ for sharing this recipe."
157136,37073,2010-04-05,4,"These were good.  We used oregano and I didn't like that flavor, my husband and boys did though.  I think next time I will add a little salt instead.  Thanks for sharing."
1123090,91626,2009-01-10,1,The instructions are not very clear on how to use the tea and more specifically what type of black tea.  We had tea leaf stuck all over the chicken and it made it inedible.  The sauce was okay and probably would have been better without the tea leaves everywhere.
724631,296983,2008-09-29,5,"5 Stars, this brings a lemon zing to potatoes, and made a good contrast to blander leftover chicken and broccoli.  I used small yellow potatoes -- the only small potatoes my market offered, and they came out very well.  Please do not go overboard by adding additional lemon zest, the amount called for will be just right.  Thanks for posting!  Made for Fall 2008 Pick-a-Chef."
446297,273326,2009-01-31,5,"OMG this was soooo good!!  I truly love to cook and when I read this recipe - I knew I had to try it.  Let me tell all of you - this is totally awesome!!  Really not at all as complicated as it seems.  Look in your spice rack - you have all these ingredients.  Followed it to a ""T' (just a little extra basil cause DH is a fanatic).  Wasn't clear as to the cooking of the salmon so i baked it on a buttered cookie sheet for the time specified and broiled it for a minute or so after (watch it closely) to get a slightly blackened effect - marvelous!!.  A definite repeat for me.  TY so very much for posting ----- excellent - looking forward to many more from you!!"
1891735,273326,2011-04-23,0,"This was absolutely DELICIOUS. I was nervous making it, it seems like every time I make a big deal about making a special dinner it always turns out so-so, but this was FANTASTIC! The only thing I noticed was that after I was done making the sauce I tasted it and the texture was a little gritty - i added some half & half and it took away the texture, and by the time i was ready to serve it, it was a little dry with the noodles in it, so i added just a bit of water and it was perfect. Thanks for posting!"
6258,24514,2002-04-22,5,"My, my, what a wonderful mouthful of flavors!!!
Artichokes and garlic are wonderful together.  I did not change the recipe at all.
We are not Sunday nite dinner eaters, just bites or appetizers.  This dish was just perfect.  We loved the flavors, and so easy to make, and was very satisfying.
Thanks Miller for posting this one!"
63031,24514,2003-08-09,3,"this was okay, i think the smaller you can cut the hearts and still handle them the better,   "
95210,24514,2005-07-04,5,"I made this for an ""emergency"" snack tonight and they were superb.  I didn't bother to saute the hearts, just poured the butter with garlic that I'd microwaved over them. "
230557,24514,2005-08-18,5,"Best artichoke appetizer I've tried so far, and I've been trying a lot lately.  Such a refreshing change from the dip recipes!  I also didn't saut√© the chokes after frying - and I didn't have unsalted butter, and I used quartered chokes, might do smaller next time because I just love the flavor.  Very yummy, simple, and unique."
183098,24514,2006-01-03,5,"Great appetizer!  And so easy!  I too just drizzled the garlic butter over them.  I did have some left over, and the next evening I heated them up in the oven and melted a piece of provolone on each --Mmmmmmmmmmm.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!
--Marla  "
201064,24514,2007-04-26,5,"I can't believe I forgot to rate this recipe!! I'm so sorry! I love artichoke hearts and made this recipe with them.  My family fell in love with these, and so did I.  Like other people I did saute my hearts in garlic butter but instead just poured it on top of the hot hearts.  They were fabulous.  Thanks Miller for such an easy yet great recipe!! :D"
529278,24514,2008-01-06,0,"We would like to make this another time before rating it.  We think it has potential, but a couple of things just didn't go right for us.  First, we don't think we rinsed enough of the brine off, because they were very sharp tasting.  Second, they didn't seem to coat well.  It was more like a stuffing than a breading.  The taste of the breading was good, but with the sharpness of the artichoke, we just dind't eat many.  We'll try again though, and hopefully do better!"
1325133,24514,2009-07-15,5,"I always fine large jars of artichoke hearts and wonder what I can make with them? So I found your recipe.  I didn't have regular bread crumbs so I substudited cornflake crumbs instead. I dipped artichoke heart into egg first. Then into dry ingrent's: garlic salt, grated asiago or any hard cheese grated is fine,pepper, and/or what ever seasons fancy your buds. 
then i sauted/fryed in oil till lightly browned. i then place on a cookie sheet and continued to bake them so they we more crunchy so they could be eaten with fingers. my kids at these up so fast that i didn't have any left to serve to our guest...also a little lemon squeezed over them after would be a good touch. i didn't have any on hand but will do it next time.
thank you 
lauri from Cleveland"
2001574261,24514,2017-06-08,5,"Tasty way of using the jar of artichoke hearts that was threatening to outlive its welcome in my fridge. I used mostly canola oil, and enough butter to go head to head with a bottle of Drain-O and still tasted the artichoke flavor when biting into the juicy center(s)!"
1098228,269984,2011-04-16,5,"This was really, really good.  My family and I enjoyed it very much.  Thank you for posting.  Will definitely make again."
12657,9999,2002-06-06,5,"Hearty and wonderful! The garam masala and curry powder made it tingly and spicy, while the veggies and beans added lovely flavour. I skipped the Tabasco sauce and pepper, and added 1/8 teaspoon salt (for 1 serving). The veggies cooked in 15 minutes. Thanks, this made a great dinner!"
6357,9999,2002-11-26,0,"I made this for dinner last night. I'm sorry, nobody enjoyed it."
65953,9999,2003-02-13,5,"Tasty!  I used only garam masala, and only one 15 oz can of kidney beans (still can't read a recipe).  Added salt, pepper and hot sauce at the same time as the garam masala so it would all cook together.  Great with plain yogurt. "
140331,9999,2005-10-08,5,"I really enjoyed this vegetarian stew.  Giving it 5 stars here.
Any vegetarians out there pop into our group on Yahoo under groups:
vegetarian_group"
283390,9999,2007-05-24,4,"This was an easy, fairly quick stew, using ingredients I already had in my pantry. The Tabasco sauce was a nice addition. I added some ground cumin seed, and I thought it contributed to the flavor, too. Thanks for posting this no-fuss, tasty recipe!"
95743,47037,2004-01-31,5,"I didn't drive seventy miles to get a papaya (and next time I will) but this was GREAT anyway.  We ate these topped with Miraklegirl's slow roasted tomatoes.  Wow!  I substituted reduced fat smoked gouda for the cheddar.  This burger goes together well, stays together while cooking and is PACKED with flavor.  Outstanding!"
4470,47037,2004-07-18,4," I enjoyed this burger, loved the thyme but felt that the papaya really did nothing to add to the flavor (perhaps it was this particular papaya). The texture of the burger was perfect, held in the cheese and was easy to handle. Thanks for another Saturday night burger.  I will look up the ""Burger Meisters"" cookbook, thanks for the tip"
377070,47037,2007-07-07,4,We didn't make the entire recipe - just used the spice mixture in the beef and used the patties for another recipe.  (recipe #231686) Will be using this as a base for other burgers as well.  I think next time I'll add minced garlic to it.
6357,30473,2002-11-03,5,"Wonderful! I have drank so many glasses of this tea in the past fortnight when I was down with a running nose. Ginger tea was a boon to me.
I did use fresh tea leaves and yes, also I did use milk. A wonderful recipe!"
74652,30473,2003-12-26,5,"I made this tea when I was down with a cold last week and it was so soothing and tasted great!  I added  a little milk because I like hot tea with it.  Thanks for sharing 
"
110034,30473,2004-09-06,5,"What a nice little kick the ginger provides!  I really like this not only for its obvious properties (denauseating, decongesting) but for the easy way for me to get down my local honey every morning without being overcome by the sugar.  Thanks so much for posting this!"
65056,30473,2004-09-09,5,"I was kind of surprised at how good this is!  The strong flavors of ginger and tea work in wonderful harmony- neither overpowers the other (as ginger and tea have the tendancy to do) but each makes the other seem a little mellower out of its strength.  (If that makes sense...)  So, yeah... in short- the tea flavor and the ginger flavor went well together.  I've never had 'ginger tea' that had actual tea leaves in it. BF couldn't figure out what it was when I served it to him- he couldn't place the ginger or the tea flavor really because they blend so well.  I used assam black tea leaves and added a touch of lemon juice rather than milk.  BF and I had been feeling kind of funny in our bellies all day and this did the trick for that too in addition to being delicious!   Thanks for posting."
86318,30473,2004-12-06,4,"Hmmm. This is a nice hot drink, and warmed me up, which is what I wanted. Somehow, though, the ginger-tea combination isn't really something that works real well for my tastebuds. I adore ginger, but like Roosie says, the tea and ginger sort of cancel each other out. In my case, I would have prefered the ginger to take over, I guess. Thank you for a new experience."
101823,30473,2004-12-28,4,This is a nice calming sipper.  I used crystallized ginger and liked the extra bit of sweetness.  I also used decaffeinated tea and omitted the milk.  This is good even if you aren't nauseated.  :)
169969,30473,2005-11-17,5,"This gets five stars from me.... i have been sick to my stomach with a head ache for two days and I really believe this is working! And, i think it tastes great!"
153878,30473,2005-12-02,5,"After an earache, headache, and vertigo.. this opened my sinus. Used Celestal Seasoning Lemon Tea.. ginger has been reported to help prevent migranes if drunk daily... I'm game.  Thank you. p.s. used Splenda"
668875,30473,2008-04-27,5,Great tea.  Used a green tea and orange tea bag and omitted the honey.  Absolutely sensation - I will drink this instead of coffee from now on.
632249,30473,2008-04-30,4,My little girl had a tummy ache for a few days and this seemed to soothe her. Whatever makes them happy and comfortable when they are sick makes me a happy mom! Thank you very much.
384041,30473,2009-01-02,5,WOW. 4 pregnancies have left me very familiar with the effectiveness of ginger against nausea but I'd never thought to pair it with tea before. I didn't think the ginger would go through the garlic press so I put it into a sandwich bag and pulverized it with a meat hammer. Then I made it in the coffeepot with plenty of black tea. The family liked it so much that they immediately demanded a second pot -- made even stronger.
64667,205331,2007-04-02,4,"Oooh, this was SUCH a breath of fresh spring air!!!   I didn't have any parsley, and I used two green onions for the shallot, and I omitted the pepperonici completely since no one here is into them.   But wow--oh wow!!  Ymmmm!   

I ran the green onions (shallot), red wine & vinegar through my little food chopper, rested a bit, then added the olive oil in three little batches, swirled for a second.  Poured that over the ""salad"" and it looked neat with the flecks of green onion in there.    

The BEST part was the toasted bagel chips we dipped in the juice that accumulated on the bottom of the salad.  

Definitely a KEEPER!"
20480,205331,2007-04-27,5,"We love Greek Salad and this one is so good.I didn't have any pepperoncini peppers and I added some Feta cheese but followed the rest of the recipe.I made this for PAC. Thank you for sharing.

37449,205331,2007-12-31,4,"A yummy salad which I enjoyed along with some spaghetti for dinner. I left out the tuna, and used marinated artichokes and scaled it down to serve one. Thanks so much for a delightful salad!"
1052065,92533,2009-11-13,5,"This worked as a dieters cheesecake although I think if I made it again I would add more splenda.
I made this for My-3-Chefs November 2009.
Thanks for sharing mermaidmagic."
186578,92533,2017-05-01,5,"Delicious. I am not an experienced cheesecake maker but I was easily able to make this perfectly. I did make a substitution, though - I used part Erythritol (2/3 c) and part Erythritol + Stevia (1/3 c) blend (both granulated) instead of Splenda."
287420,78655,2007-06-03,4,"This was a really good sandwich, I used fresh basil as I have so much growing at the moment! I found that chopping the olive salad ingredients very finely meant I didn't need to process which gave the sandwich a nice texture (less washing up too!) I spread the olive salad / spread on the top and bottom of the bread before layering the other ingredients. Great recipe thank you for posting!"
51292,108804,2005-01-22,5,"Wow, what great tastes together! DH made it for a family dinner and it was terrific. Low in fat too. I'll be making this often and now understand why you made your hubby put his fork down."
171303,108804,2005-04-18,5,"I made this last night to have for lunch today and was glad I gave it time for the flavors to blend.  This is a delightful salad, fresh and flavorful.  I'm sure I will make this again and next time add even more garlic as we love garlic.  Thank you Debbie for sharing the recipe."
97686,108804,2005-07-06,5,"Great recipe, Debby!  It's perfect as written.  Today I tried it stuffed in a pita half with some tomato, but I actually perfer it right out of the bowl I mixed it in.  Good thing the salad is so healthful, because I find it hard to put down my fork!"
104295,108804,2005-07-21,5,This was a lovely lunch.  I used cannelini beans and think that the ingredient that pushes this beyond regular bean salads is the basil.  Next time I may add a little more.  I also reduced the oil by 1 tbsp. and upped the vinegar by 1 tbsp.  A great and easy lunch just out of the bowl.
98212,108804,2005-07-24,5,Healthy and delicious!  What more could you ask. Shared with my sister & we both loved it.  Next time I may add a bit more vinegar.  I'll bet it would also be good with the salmon in a pouch.
278020,108804,2005-12-27,5,"I'm not a fan of tuna so I used a jar of home canned salmon. I also used a can of Bean Medley (garbanzo, kidney, black) and it was delicious. 

Next time I'll also add a bit more vinegar. Otherwise a very nice change for lunch. "
20480,108804,2006-06-07,5,"I was looking for a different kind of tuna salad and found your recipe;Fantastic!!!
I added 2 roasted red peppers and chopped olives.Thanks for sharing Debbie"
260689,108804,2006-08-30,2,"Very easy to put together, but I found it needed more vinegar and a salt
Quite tasty and an easy to make light lunch"
136352,108804,2006-10-11,3,"I liked this. I'm so used to tuna salads that are Mayo based, so this was new to me. I didn't have fresh basil, used 1 tesp. dry. I used the Great Northern Beans, and cut back on the salt..still, very good. "
68715,108804,2007-04-01,5,"I used balsamic vinegar, its the closest I had, and added a splash more. This is fabulous salad! Ds and I really enjoyed it."
29300,108804,2007-04-23,5,This was excellent and healthy too. I have never heard of white kidney beans so I used 1 can of great northern beans and 1 can of garbanzo beans (I doubled the recipe)and I used olive oil and a red pepper. I did not use the lettuce though. This recipe was nice and light. Not too filling. Just right. This is a definite keeper. Thank you.
747844,108804,2008-02-07,5,This was excellent. The basil is the key to making this stand out. The only thing I added was a little lemon juice to heighten the other flavors. We will definitely eat this all summer long!
326039,108804,2008-06-18,5,"I can't believe I haven't yet rated this recipe, and the partner and I have been enjoying it for 2 summers now.  Just made it last night, and it is so satisfying as a main dish salad.  I had some miscellaneous veggies (celery, yellow bell pepper, and sugar snap peas) that I threw in as well.

Wonderful recipe that has made it into our Summer rotation.  Thanks!"
465911,108804,2009-05-01,5,so tasty. I love all the ingredients so it is exactly the kind of recipe that makes me not be able to put my fork down! I used an orange pepper and had mine on top of a salad with shredded carrot. Yum! I will use again.
808063,108804,2009-05-01,5,"Tasty, and very easy. I didn't have all the right ingredients: I used apple cider vinegar, dried basil, cucumbers and tomatoes (instead of the peppers), and no scallions. Still, delish!"
1182971,108804,2009-05-26,4,"This was pretty good.  I didn't have canned beans, so I used some dry ones that I boiled until they were soft.  Thanks for the recipe, it is a nice change for tuna salad."
609659,108804,2009-08-18,5,Wow this was really good! It was a nice HEALTHFUL change to regular tuna salad. YUM YUM you just have to try some!
1416454,108804,2009-12-30,4,Tasty and healthy!
606850,108804,2012-07-22,4,"I used apple cider vinegar, garlic powder, and oregano parsley (what I had). I put in at least twice as many multi-colored bell peppers! To up the tang (white beans are quite plain), I added quite a bit of pickle brice, and a small scoop of finely chopped dill pickles. I ate mine with a side of toast for some crunch. Tasty and quite filling!<br/><br/>Next time, a chopped tomato might go well ... and artichoke hearts ..."
949587,108804,2012-07-23,5,This tasted fantastic! I used balsamic vinegar and a whole red pepper.
350627,108804,2014-07-27,4,"Thanks for sharing a lovely summer recipe! It&#039;s healthy, and quick to put together. I made a couple of modifications: 15 oz of white beans (1 can), 15 oz of tuna (3 x 5 oz cans), and only 2 tbsp of olive oil. The only change I&#039;d make next time is to use a slightly zippier vinegar, maybe balsamic, in place of the red wine vinegar."
740235,343448,2009-07-11,4,I didn't have all these spices in my kitchen but what resulted is a rub that everyone in my house LOVES. We put it on Salmon and chicken and steak and even in our ground beef for hamburgers! I omitted the coriander and replaced whole red peppers for the ground. I usually leave out most of the paprika. I've been using it about a year now and everyone always asks me what I put on my meat. Thanks Amy!
1365025,343448,2009-09-21,5,This is an excellent steak rub. I had everything on hand except the turmeric. The next batch I make I'll use less red pepper thought as it was a little  hot for my taste. This is a keeper for sure. Thanks for a great steak rub.
250238,343448,2011-05-08,3,I hate to give this rub such a mediocre review but it was just okay. It wasn't like Outback. It wasn't overly flavorful but it was really salty. I made this with marinaded shrimp skewers and everybody commented on the shrimp but there was steak leftover and people still had plenty of room left for dessert immediately following dinner.
44642,217201,2007-03-18,2,"Sarah, I looked at this and said I have to try it.With all these spices it really was very bland.If I did it again I would up the amount to at least 3/4 or even 1 tea.DH put hot sauce all over it and he ate some of it.Have never seen rice and water in same amount, so I did 1 rice to 2 water.perhaps that was wrong.You are a clever girl, don't think you will go hungry, LOL"
58104,164291,2006-04-27,4,"A quick, easy, great  way to use left over chicken. I added a bit of minced jalapeno peppers, and curry powder. Nice crunch from the peppers. Thanks!!!!"
53932,164291,2006-10-07,5,"I really enjoyed this.  I used a tomato herb feta which added just a little more flavor.  I didn't have light mayo because I just hate the stuff, but I bet even that would taste good with the additions in this recipe.  Thank you for sharing."
400960,164291,2006-12-05,4,I have not tried it yet but the ingredients have my tast buds jumping already! Stay tuned for the results.
374404,164291,2006-12-26,4,"Very nice.  I used chicken thighs instead of breast as breast can be a little dry, which I cut into bite sized pieces and then fried then cooled.  I used home made mayo (full fat).  This was enjoyed by all at my luncheon.  Thanks"
95743,164291,2008-01-17,4,"I felt the need to add to satrt adding things, like curry, cumin and cayenne.  Great basic chicken salad."
315565,164291,2009-08-05,4,I served this on a bed of lettuce and I think the leftovers will be great in a sandwich tomorrow !
452940,100870,2008-10-02,4,"Don't we all love dressing up plain old jar sauce? Sommer, you've got a great knack for doing so and this one is no exception. Made as directed using half the amount of stewed tomatoes (that's all we had), 3 cloves of garlic, 1 tsp sugar, and draining the ground beef through a mesh strainer. We also added about a Tbsp of Italian seasoning and a splash of olive oil. Delicious!"
9528,26995,2002-05-18,0,"I haven't tried your particular recipe yet but remember many years ago a friend gave me a cup of starter that sounds similar to this. According to her, the starter was from a batch that was many years old and had come a long way. I never checked the validity of this but had no reason to doubt her word.
My job with my portion was to ""feed"" it a cup of flour and a cup of milk (or water--can't remember) every week. As I needed it for biscuits or whatever, I took the amount out I needed. The important thing was never to forget to feed it or it would die. Sadly I don't have the starter now as I must have slipped up years ago!
At any rate, it was super and made great biscuits, quick breads, pancakes, etc."
83929,26995,2003-04-28,0,"I had a 'mixture' for over 8 years which made 3 cakes every 10 days - it was a very similar recipe and process.  Apples were the suggested fruit but I have used just about every fruit there is - banana, pineapple and apple being the most successful.  Over the years I exhausted my friends and contacts who wanted to have a 'share' and used to make the cakes and freeze them.

The wonderful thing about this mixture was that you could leave it/forget it/ignore it for days  but it would soon come back to life with the addition of milk, flour and sugar.

I had to finish with my 'old mixture' when we emigrated to New Zealand but I will be starting another one soon !"
111359,26995,2003-11-07,5,"This is a moist, delicious cake. The hardest part of the recipe is waiting the ten days."
190981,26995,2005-01-27,5,I am so glad to have found this recipe again! It is also awesome with stewed apples instead of the pineapple. I have also made it with grated carrot! Excellent as muffins;in a fluted ring pan or as a loaf. So versatile!
141277,26995,2010-05-06,5,A friend gave me a bag of Amish Friendship Bread that had the starter in it.  The recipe was nearly identical to this (except the starter) but it did not include the fruit.  It was super tasty and easy to make.  After a about 4 repitions I was a little overwhelmed with the amount of bread it made (just me and my 4yr old son). Now with my husband home from Afghanistan I should make it again (and again and again). Thanks! Saeriu
110905,84797,2004-12-26,5,"We had fondue for Christmas Dinner. I made your garlic dill sauce, it was wonderful. I have plenty leftover, but I think it would be great with chips!"
198228,84797,2005-04-06,5,I made the honey mustard sauce with grilled chicken - my husband (who's VERY picky) loved it!  I did double the amount of honey that I used 
11176,84797,2006-01-11,0,"I'm not going to rate this because I only made the garlic dill recipe.  Even though we're diehard garlic lovers, I would have to cut WAY back on the fresh garlic to enjoy this sauce.  Certainly a lot of potential here, but I'll ease up next time to maybe 1/2 teaspoon. Also I used dried dill and should have used fresh. I'm saving this to try the other sauces as well. Thank you, Bergy."
257993,84797,2007-02-16,5,"I tried only the three sauces and they were very good.  Thanks, Bergy, for posting."
123871,84797,2007-02-26,5,I made this for valetines day with a cheese fondue and a chocolate desert fondue. The sauces were very good. I really liked the garlic dill and my husbands favorite was the honey mustard. Very good. Thanks!!
560694,84797,2008-03-25,5,Excellent selection of sauces for fondue & beyond. I made teh garlic dill for our fondue night & the honey mustard just to try it.  I liked the dill w/our salmon & chicken.  I plan halve it in the future as a little extra to go with some grilled or broiled fish.  The honey mustard was just a little 'more' than the bottled stuff - def. worth the small effort involved.  I plan to make it again for chicken strips.
509740,84797,2008-05-30,3,Not the usual sauces I would use for fondue but they were ok for a change.
128047,84797,2009-01-01,4,"I thought the honey mustard was good when I made it but got sweeter as it sat.  The barbecue sauce was really good, I added about twice as much lemon juice and lots of hot sauce.  The garlic dill sauce was in need of lots of salt, especially on meat that was unsalted.  I think next time I'll salt my meat after I cut it into chunks and skip the honey mustard sauce and just use the hot mustard."
45368,31835,2002-06-26,0,pretty dang good
60992,31835,2006-08-28,5,"This is SO good! Since the recipe did not state how to cook the squash, I diced it and sauteed it and the onion in the melted butter till softened. I seasoned this with a dash of garlic powder, seasoned salt and pepper. I found that half a pan of crumbled jiffy cornbread mix prepared was the 2 cups needed. I mixed all remaining ingredients with a generous dash of poultry seasoning. The flavor and texture of this dish is outstanding. We served it with BBQ ribs and were in hog heaven. What a fantastic way to use summer squash."
337963,31835,2007-06-27,5,"I would give this 10 stars if I could.  Incredibly delicious!!!  I used half yellow squash and half zucchini, both peeled.  I also used cream of celery soup since I like that flavor better.  I added 1/4 t salt and some pepper as well.  Had to cook it quite a bit longer, more like 50 minutes.  Thank you Gabriel!"
251686,31835,2008-06-09,5,This is good!!!  I make mexican corn bread with creamed corn and jalapenos and cheese in it.  Thats what I used.  It was outstanding.
1388586,31835,2009-09-20,5,"Great taste and wonderful with chicken! This is very fast to throw together. When I bake a hen, this is what I serve for a vegetable and my bread. I got the recipe from a church cookbook, when travling through a small town in north Georgia. I was going to post my recipe, but this one is almost identical. The only difference is 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. I always use cream of chicken soup and no sage."
2242149,31835,2012-04-18,0,"This is close to a very special lady's recipe I know. She shared her recipe w/me (doesn't share many) however, I misplaced and too embarassed to request it again. Now this lady is a super cook. She even baked a coconut cake that sold at an auction to raise $$ for my sick father and it went way over $100 almost $200 so if someone is willing to pay that you must know she can give some people a tough cook off. So glad I found this!!!!! Just hope mine turns out close to hers."
2553649,31835,2014-06-02,5,My husband&#039;s aunt gave me this recipe way back in the 70&#039;s - she was an exceptional cook.  I made this at Christmas and my mom  who is now 87 requests it every year.  Who knew it was squash!  Can&#039;t beat and still sharing this recipe.
1310146,44061,2011-08-21,5,"I wasn't sure how this was going to turn out, but tried it anyway. It was easy to make and turned out my first try. I put it on my meatloaf and it was the best I ever made!  It would take some getting used plain on french fries and such, but I use it in any recipe that calls for ketsup.  Even my homemade BBQ sauce!  I did seal it in canning jars and it held up nicely.  I can't say how long the shelf-life is because I used it up quickly.  Hint:  Place a couple strips of bacon on top of the sauce when making your meatloaf for something extra special."
320685,24137,2006-05-29,5,well done i just made it the othor day.realy good.
198228,25274,2005-02-26,2,"The fennel and garlic were a bit overpowering, I might try lowering the amount next time...."
27783,53872,2003-03-06,5,"Oustanding meatloaf!In fact, this was one of the best I have ever made.  It is rich and flavorful and despite containing only soy cheese, very cheesey in both taste & appearance.  It was delicious!  I halved the recipe and still cooked it for the full time - it came out perfect.Also,  I was unable to get the soy cheese in shredded form, so I used ""Veggie Slices Soy Cheese"" and finely diced it -worked out great.  "
196586,53872,2005-04-17,5,"Love It!  Thanks for a great meatloaf recipe. No lactose intolerance here, so I used medium cheddar cheese and it turned out great.  The leftovers made excellent sandwiches. "
247405,23850,2009-04-27,5,This soup recipe was a great inspiration to me. I added  8 oz. fresh mushrooms and used a bag of frozen cauliflower instead of fresh.  I also did not puree the soup.  We all loved it.
34206,44123,2003-03-23,5,"I just can't say enough about how wonderful this soup is.  Of course, I am a sucker for anything with cream in it and this one does not disappoint.  I will be making this again and again but I will triple the chicken and broccoli because. This is the perfect dish for a casual get together.  I served it with your jalepeno/cheese cornbread (review follows).  Oh, my DH and DS LOVED it, too.  Thanks, GinnyP."
76503,44123,2003-06-03,5,This soup is the Bomb! Don't hesitate to try....Your family and guests will talk about this for a long while. I'm hooked!
173558,44123,2005-01-14,5,This was so good. All my picky eaters turned their noses up at it until I asked them to please try it. Not one complaint came from anybody. I will make this again for sure.  Thanks GinnyP for posting this recipe!
743566,44123,2008-01-28,5,"I lived in San Diego for 19 years and  would go to George's at least twice a year just to sit on the terrace, look at the ocean and enjoy this soup.  Soup, house salad & a glass of white wine.  Perfection!"
653438,445026,2011-01-13,5,Made for dinner yesterday and yummmo!  I did cut the recipe in half and left out the black-eyed peas but otherwise followed the recipe.  Another winner from Gailanng!  Thank you.  Made for New Kids on the Block tag game.
2000498330,445026,2016-08-20,4,Took more like 20 minutes to get the roux the color of chocolate. Pretty good flavor but is missing something.
385886,48131,2006-11-21,5,"The recipe could be a little more informative, but the pie turned out wonderful I LOVED IT!"
426430,48131,2008-11-05,5,"Amazing. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I used 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 teaspoon cloves. Really great straight from the oven."
1800345381,48131,2013-12-02,4,Great tasting pie.  I&#039;m planning on making this pie again!
57101,111462,2005-03-03,5,"Not a vegetarian, just like to change things up and bit and eat healthy.  LOVED these burgers...very different.  I did have to make a few changes due to availability of what was on hand... Garlic powder used instead of minced, canned corn instead of frozen (added during the cooling step), no chili sauce so I used Recipezaar's substitution recipe (which was perfect) and accidentally opened a can of green chilis, so I used that instead of salsa and added some wheat germ for nutrition.  Ate as a pattie dipped in ketchup and mustard mixed and plan on eating left overs as ""actual"" burgers.  Highly recommend trying this recipe if in the mood for something different!"
60866,111462,2006-02-27,5,We really liked these!  Much better recipe than the other black bean burgers we have tried.  This one is a keeper!
199020,111462,2006-04-19,5,"Not quite as good as the real thing, but definitely worth making if you are looking to eat a little healthier.  These would be excellent for a Weight Watchers diet.  I made my burgers without the corn and topped them with american cheese and light mayo. They are very filling.  Thanks for the recipe."
373178,111462,2007-02-28,5,"Fantastic!! I didn't have the chili sauce, so I just left it out.  I added a little green tabasco (for moisture and taste) instead.  And I added a little wheat germ (good idea Stephie!).  We ate them with pita, avacado and mayo.  We will making these again soon, I am sure!! Thank you!"
204705,111462,2007-12-10,4,"I just realized I posted the wrong review for these the first time! These were good, and very easy to make! Thanks for the recipe!"
573577,111462,2008-01-24,5,"Very good! I didn't have the green chili sauce so I just added a little extra salsa. Great flavor, easy and frugal....thank you!"
324470,111462,2008-04-05,5,"This is a new family favorite for us!  We eat the patties on whole grain bread with vegan mayonnaise, avocado, salsa, tomatoes, and alfalfa sprouts.  Yum!!"
586959,111462,2008-06-19,5,"YUM!! I've been looking for a good Black Bean Burger for a minute, this one is by far the best I have come across. My husband and 2 yr old son absolutely loved them. Very quick and easy, I also love how cheap this meal is to make. Thanks for a great recipe!"
710414,111462,2008-07-15,5,"We loved these black bean burgers!  They hold together great, are inexpensive and very yummy!  Preparation time made an easy meal for our family."
641411,111462,2008-12-12,3,"I really liked the spice of these, with the green chili sause, but I would have liked way more beans.  When I have black bean burgers, I'd like them to be more like 60/40 rather than 50/50.  Maybe next time I'd try two cans of beans.  They had good flavor, though."
360719,111462,2009-11-17,5,"These are SO GOOD. I've been craving a good black bean burger for  while now and decided to try making my own. They turned out delicious. I added adobo spice mix and a bit of fresh cilantro, then I topped them with ketchup, jack and cheddar cheese, tomato, onion, and sliced avocado on a french hamburger roll and I DIED. These rival my favorite restaurant's black bean burgers. I keep them separated into patties by wax paper in tupperware in the fridge and fry them up when I'm ready to eat. They'll go in the freezer for later once I tire of eating them for every meal!"
899585,111462,2010-03-22,5,"I am in LOVE with this recipe! It is so quick and easy to prepare, and it tastes awesome.  I nixed the onion since I don't like onions and added jalapenos to add some more spice.  UPDATE: I have been making these without the green chili sauce.  I added water, extra salsa, cayenne and jalapeno or serrano peppers. These are pretty spicy, but always hit the spot. I have been cooking an extra one for dinner and packaging it for work. tastes great reheated in the microwave! Thanks again for such a great recipe."
1564253,111462,2010-04-16,5,"These were fantastic! I added a bit more cumin after giving it an initial taste, and served them on whole wheat Slimwiches buns with pepper jack cheese as suggested, as well as with lettuce, miracle whip, and banana peppers. Filling and delicious!!"
214000,111462,2011-11-05,5,"Used only salsa (no green chili sauce on hand) and made 6 smaller patties.  Did take me a bit longer than the estimated 20 minutes to make!  Otherwise, a great recipe and will make again.  Thanks for sharing."
37036,94710,2006-09-20,5,"These fries were delicious and were a perfect side dish for one of my favorite burgers, <a href=""/186229"">The Godfather Burger</a>.  I made two changes:  First, I baked them instead of frying.  Second, I drizzled just a little olive oil over the fries before baking.  Will make again!  Thanks canarygirl!"
305531,94710,2010-01-09,5,Great fries! I've actually made these twice. I made a small batch for just me and then a large batch for the family. We had these with burgers and they were a great side dish. I added a bit of kosher salt too. Thanks canary girl for a nice keeper that my family enjoyed. Made for Cookbook Tag.
695933,94710,2013-05-29,5,"I did this for Memorial Day May 27, 2013 take some time to recognize and remember our fallen heroes, and the brave men and women who keep our country safe every day. What a great idea - can&#039;t believe I haven&#039;t tried this before! crispy on the outside and so tasty.  I used seasoned salt for the seasoning. My family really liked these fries. And say Thanks for posting this recipe, I made this for 2013 Zaar Cookbook Tag."
386585,234069,2010-04-05,5,"I was looking for something new to do to my Easter ham, and I am so glad I tried this.  I made it exactly as posted, and it was delicious.  I loved the bits of orange peel from the marmalade.  Thanks for posting this."
49304,90921,2004-06-01,5,"Delicious and very easy to make. I used Broccoli,carrots, bockchoy and snow peas. I do think that next I will just stir fry the veggies. Though they were very good this way. Dh and I both enjoyed this recipe and I will be making it again. Thank you so very much Kari."
82648,90921,2004-06-01,5,This was WONDERFUL! My husband rated it a 5 plus. The honey is so nice and mild in this dish and the flavour is fantastic. Will make this again and again!
37779,90921,2004-06-03,5,"Excellent recipe, Miss Kari. I used mushrooms(uncooked), steamed broccoli, carrots, zucchini, and red bell pepper. The sauce had a yummy flavor with no one ingredient overpowering the other. A lovely colorful veggie meal that my family and I enjoyed. Thanks."
146576,90921,2004-06-24,5,"I made this for my son and he loved it. I also stir fried the veggies (used Brocolli, Green Beans, Pearl Onions, and Red Peppers) along with adding some mushrooms. It came out great and really went well with swordfish."
119481,90921,2004-09-18,3,"This was good, but a little too oily.  Next time I think I'll modify how much oil I'm using.  Also, I used rice noodles because I love the texture.  Actually, pan frying the noodles after tossing them might help and add another layer of flavor.  I'll try again."
172256,90921,2005-03-31,3,"I cut done the oil called for in the recipe, the sauce had wonderful flavor. My family didn't care to much for the vegetables added to it. I might make it again without them."
62494,90921,2006-04-08,5,"very good recipe. i didn't think that there was a thing wrong with it. i didn't think it was too oily.  actually there was one bad thing about it, 1176 calories?! is that a misprint?  i did not add the stirfry veggies."
49937,90921,2006-08-21,4,"I made this recipe with Bourbon Chicken last weekend. It was really good! I added a tablespoon of peanut butter to my sauce, to make more of a peanutty sauce. Next time I may not do that, everyone seemed to like it though! Thanks!! :)"
402559,90921,2008-04-21,5,"I used a bunch of left over Oriental flavor Ramen noodles and the flavor was fantastic! I will definitely be making this again but I think I will make this as a main dish next time adding some chicken marinated in the oil, soy sauce, honey, garlic, onion and sesame seeds before adding it to the noodles and veggies. Thanks!"
259150,90921,2008-05-30,5,"My family and I loved this dish.  Did not use the stir fry veggies (didn't have any).  I served this as a side dish to a sesame crusted seared tuna (we were in sesame heaven, lol).  YUMMY!"
171084,90921,2008-08-25,5,What a great recipe!  Incredibly easy and perfect compliment recipe#54114!  I did cut back on the oil to 1/4 cup and don't feel it made any difference.  Thanks for posting a great recipe!
583643,90921,2011-07-31,0,"Quick and impressive! I used only half lb of ww pasta and cut down the dressing to about 2/3. Sliced in yday's steak, and voila! Solid meal for 4 adults, unless one of them is my DH :)"
52448,83950,2004-05-27,5,"I enjoyed making this sauce and eating it!! Was affraid that the oregano would be too much but found it just right. I did use more red pepper flakes then you stated in the recipe, probably double. Halve of the sauce I have put in the freezer for a day that I don't want or can do much cooking.
I served it this time with spaghetti.
Thanks!!"
153067,83950,2006-04-02,5,"I made this last night for some guests that came by...holy Pete it was AWESOME!  ...Lets see...changes I made...well, I had leftover portabellos..they went in...used Venison instead of beef....no sage (didn't feel like digging to find it in my cabinet!)....other than that, I followed the directions to the T!  I will definately make this many more times!  Thank you for sharing CC!  LA :-)"
184840,83950,2006-11-30,5,This was so lovely!  Had my mother in law to visit and went for this Bolognese Sauce!! Well we all thought that it was the BEST Bolognese we ever had!! Thank you for this great recipe!
420784,83950,2007-12-31,5,"What an awesome and easy recipe!  I forgot to add the garlic, but I don't think I missed it. I also used a ""meatloaf"" mix of ground beef, pork and veal.  The one step I messed up was the bacon.  I had cut the bacon before I put it in with the onion mix and then had to fish out the fatty pieces, oops! Nonetheless, it was an awesome recipe with outstanding flavor.  I will certainly be making this again!!!  Thanks for sharing!"
48065,83950,2008-02-01,5,"Okay, so I really altered this a bit but...it received rave reviews so I will save it print it and use it again and again! I used the first 6 ingredients and for the meat I used my leftover Ravioli meat #27951, it was well seasoned. I added 1 beef bouillon cube, 1c red wine instead of white,plain tomato pieces and used the nutmeg..my milk product was the mixed in cheese from the ravioli filling...What can I say, it sure was all mixed up delicious!!"
971620,83950,2008-09-29,5,"Thanks Classic Chef!
This is probably the best bolognese sauce recipe I have ever made. Love the recipe! Taste great, will definitely make it over and over again!
Only thing I altered was that I added in a heap of mushrooms (a mushroom lover) and instead of using the ground pork, I substituted it with a little extra bacon and it turned out great!

Thanks a lot!

579298,83950,2008-11-29,5,Loved loved loved this! There is nothing quite like a hearty bolognese sauce :) I stumbled upon a slight problem with mine - I am considering adding more beef consomme next time... or perhaps extra milk. It turned out slightly too thick and dry for our liking. But the flavor is devine. Mmmm.
1252508,83950,2010-03-08,5,"I have made this recipe 4 times now.  Excellent hearty sauce.  I do tweak it a tiny bit.  I use mild italian sausage, instead of ground pork (keeping the oregano and sage as ingredients); and I add two bay leaves.  I also add just a sprinkle of sugar to cut down on the acidity of the tomatoes.  That is a southern thing!  I have used both red and white wines, either is just as good.  I choose not to add the milk.  I like the red coloring.  Overall, the most delicious bolognese recipe I have ever used."
1578978,83950,2010-03-17,5,"Thanks Chef for your endorsement that garlic belongs in Bolognese.  I've been mortified to read in the British press recently that Antonio Carluccio dismisses all Bolognese recipes containing garlic and herbs as inauthentic and invented for the UK market!  That said, this recipe is pretty close to the one I've evolved over many years.  An ex-boyfriend's Italian mother from the North of Italy used chopped Italian sausage along with the ground beef, this added some chilli heat and also a hint of fennel to the sauce so I was intrigued see chilli flakes featuring here too.  I too use nutmeg but for nostalgia!  I sometimes substitute freshly ground fennel seeds.  I also find cooking slowly in the oven gives the sauce a dark mahogany colour and a richness that cooking on the hob sometimes misses.  It's the Maillard reaction I believe!"
875616,83950,2010-03-21,5,"Didn't have sage or bacon on hand, but still kicked @$$! 4 hrs on low heat, another hour in the oven with my herb bread.  All my kids loved it tonight, can't wait for leftovers tomorrow!"
1622259,83950,2010-05-26,5,"didnt use bacon or minced pork,used 1 tbls of margand+left out salt(my 2 yr old eats what i eat) whacked aubergene and courgette in it aswell as carrot and celery
IT WAS FAB
will defo try full recipe just for me and the wife!
would never have put milk and nutmeg in a spag bol,genius!"
1092630,83950,2011-05-15,5,"Delicious recipe!  The bacon didn't quite work the way it was described -- the fat didn't cook off with the vegetables, so I fried the bacon separately, chopped it, and added it back in.  I also added half a can of tomato paste to make it just a little more tomato-y.  Quite smoky-tasting -- will try pancetta next time -- but once I added the homemade fettucine and grated parmesan, this was heavenly!"
655579,83950,2011-08-08,5,"This was amazing! This is going to be my meat sauce recipe forever.  I think the sage gave it such an interesting twist, and I would've never thought to add milk.  I usually add red wine to my sauce, but the white worked really well with this. Will try red wine next time just to see what the difference would be.  The only change I made was to cut the red pepper flakes amt in half because my kids don't do spicy, but it still had an underlying spice that seemed perfect.  Can't wait to have leftovers!!"
2189840,83950,2012-02-21,0,"This is an incredible recipe. The flavors are so complex and it's such a hearty and tasty sauce. This is my now go to Bolognese recipe. The only change I made was instead of adding the salt, I added the rind of some left over Parmigiano-Reggiano and let it simmer with the sauce, then removed before serving. (I got this idea from Rachel Ray, and it adds a wonderful flavor to any pasta sauce). Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe. My family and I thank you."
852554,83950,2012-04-19,5,This deserves 10 stars! I can honestly say this is the best pasta sauce I have ever made! Only one small change - I added a tbsp of tomato paste as suggested by another reviewer. Served over spaghetti squash! Made for PAC Spring '12.
126440,83950,2012-07-18,5,Loved this sauce.  Easy to do but gives so much flavor.  Will have to make this one often.
496803,83950,2012-09-17,4,"I used regular American bacon for this, and found it to be REALLY salty.  Other than that, I'd like to try radiatori for the pasta- I think it would hold the sauce better than the penne did.  The flavors were good, and well developed, just a little salty from the the bacon."
419076,83950,2012-10-12,5,I always use this recipe to make bolognese sauce and its always delicious!
2582546,83950,2012-12-22,0,"We made this tonight! It was perfecto:) Loved it! We used ribbon pasta! It works better to me with the sauce consistency. This will be my *bolognese"" from now on! *****"
448443,83950,2013-08-30,4,This has a very nice flavor profile. I didn&#039;t have sage so I substituted marjoram plus I used mild pork sausage. Other than that I stayed true. I will cut out fat next time (which is why only four stars) but I would highly recommend this. Nice job!
62264,83950,2014-01-15,5,Total solid keeper recipe that tripled well. Used the triple batch for a ginormous lasagne - all of which was completely consumed. Thanks for the keeper recipe!
1802879908,83950,2014-07-03,5,"I didn&#039;t use fat, the grinded meat wasn&#039;t too lean anyway. Also I didn&#039;t use beef consomme. It tastes great anyway, very close to what I ate in a restaurant but not better or worse, just a little bit different."
2383455,83950,2015-05-01,5,"I have been making this recipe since I found it 5 years ago.  I just realized I&#039;ve never given it a review which is quite the crime as it is my families and friends favorite dish.  THIS is the BEST bolognese you will ever try!  Hands down!  I make the recipe exactly as instructed but with one change.  I use ground sausage instead of ground pork.  This first happened on accident (sending husband to the market)  I went with it, and it was delicious.  It is fabulous both ways but with the sausage it adds that extra kick.  Oh and instead of using American bacon I use Pancetta chopped up.  It&#039;s not as fatty and gives it a lovely authentic Italian flavor.   A lot of reviews recommended using more tomatoes..  I would suggest just trying it like this.  Bolognese is actually a meat sauce not a red sauce.  The tomato infused beef is what us Americans  have made the dish into, which is also good, but not this dish....which is excellent.  If you want tomato sauce have meat ball marinara. If you want REAL bolognese try this dish.  Thank you Chef for sharing!"
2000234505,83950,2015-05-29,0,"I am sorry, but I am 100 times more authentic than this recipe!"
2000248303,83950,2015-06-10,4,"This is a great basic recipe. I tweaked it a bit to suit my tastes, but this is my new go-to Bolognese from now on. Bravo. 
I doubled the garlic and added some chopped kalamata olives, but that&#039;s it."
2000286751,83950,2015-06-21,5,"This recipe led to one of the better Bolognese sauces that I have ever had.  

I occasionally have to work long hours overnight in my home office so I was looking for a recipe that would take a few hours to make to help pass some of the time.  I followed this recipe as closely as possible (I eyeballed most of the herbs, spices, and wet ingredients) and let it simmer for around 3 hours.  It was absolutely delicious and I would say that it could rival any Italian grandmother&#039;s recipe.

Next time I make this I will add just a touch more salt though.  All in all, this was a fantastic recipe."
2000341165,83950,2015-07-15,5,Easy and excellent.
2000348941,83950,2015-07-19,4,Good recipe.  You can make it better if you use half cup of heavy cream instead of milk
2000382887,83950,2015-08-04,5,"My summer ambition has been to stop using so many premade items, and start learning to make sauces from scratch. This recipe made a solid bolognese sauce! I made a couple changes, like blending all the ingredients after the meat cooks through and the consumme evaporates. Made for a lovely consitency. Also added a can of cream of chicken to cut out some of the acidity of the tomatoes. I prefer a less robust taste, and this takes it some. :)"
2000492725,83950,2015-09-23,1,This is not authentic in the loosest sense of term. I am from Arba in Friuli Italy and this is not even close to the bolognese sauce that you buy from store. dissapointing.
40538095,83950,2015-10-21,3,"Really was looking forward to this since I had a delightful bolognese about 30 years ago ...and none since! I followed the directions exactly, but the end product was very salty. If I make this again, I will omit salt until the end. Should I go as far as low sodium consomm&eacute;? Also, I would definitely do pancetta, as trying to separate the lean from the fat on the bacon was a little too labor intensive for me."
2000212879,83950,2015-11-08,3,This is a very flavorful dish. I went into this using low salt everything except the beef base and it was still very salty.
2000321367,83950,2015-12-11,5,This recipe was the BEST.  Easy to due an flavor was amazing. Keeper
2000917143,83950,2016-03-13,5,"Really, really delicious recipe, even my fussy 3 year old gobbled it up.  I used a beef bone broth in place of the consomme as it was what I had on hand.  This recipe takes longer to prepare than the one I usually use but it&#039;s definitely worth the time."
2001294368,83950,2016-12-12,1,"Good recipe but don't call it Italian bolognese because it isn't there are no carrot's, celery, butter, wine, sage, pork, or milk and nutmeg. Real italian bolognese is simple olive oil, onion, garlic, tomato's, and mince. None of this extra garbage to ruin the taste."
2001354808,83950,2017-01-16,0,"I got dumped before finishing, sorry you guys missed out on the best receipt directly from Bologna you will ever read. I'll come back another time. When you see &quot;mikimoto&quot; it'll be me."
1654501,83950,2017-01-17,5,excellent Bolognaise sauce
2001462566,83950,2017-03-29,5,"Excellent authentic bolognese, real meat sauce not the watered down marinara like sauce we have turned it into. Turns out perfect everytime. The only thing I change is I use sausage meat along with pork, and veal when making it. As well as substituting pancetta instead of bacon."
2001489212,83950,2017-04-14,3,&quot;real&quot; bolognese has chicken livers ...
2001513061,83950,2017-04-29,0,Where area the chicken livers in this recipe?
2001517317,83950,2017-05-01,0,"I've made this twice now and it got raves from everyone, including my hard-to-please husband! We did make a couple changes -- we didn't add milk either time, and the 2nd time, I used a little more meat than the recipe amount, and I added a small can of tomato paste. We just loved it ..."
2001538072,83950,2017-05-15,4,I made this recipe tonight exactly as written using bacon. It was really good. The only thing that I will change the next time is to use pancetta. If you use bacon use a really good cut and cut the salt in half. I let it cook for 3 hours and it was delicious. This is a keeper!
839730,83950,2017-06-01,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! The only thing I do differently is use pancetta instead of bacon. I always freeze half because we can't eat it all for one dinner. I made lasagna with the thawed bolognese and it was the best lasagna I've ever had. Thank you for sharing this recipe.
2001443325,83950,2017-07-17,5,"This recipe is a fan favorite at my house. My 6'2&quot; 15 year old told me to hide the rest because he always eats too much. I have made it with pancetta and bacon and I agree with other reviewers that pancetta is better but the bacon is still extremely good, but I do it separately because the excess bacon fat is too much for me. Don't leave out the milk friends...you will never know it is there and it completes this recipe!!! YUM."
2001633917,83950,2017-07-19,5,"This was absolutely, unbelievably delicious. I am completely obsessed and my hard to please wife with family from Italy told me she couldn't believe how amazing it was. I followed the recipe exact except no milk no sage. Thank you SO MUCH! Will be making this as my new dish to show off to friends and family!"
2001759112,83950,2017-10-20,5,"I searched across the far reaches of the internet for a bolognese recipe to dedicate my time to. If you want the best results, I think that half of the work comes before you even start to measure out your first ingredient. My research was well-founded. This recipe is fantastic! I have made it many times, and have tried many variations."
2001778219,83950,2017-11-04,5,"This recipe is definitely the best bolognese sauce recipe that i‚Äôve ever cooked. I added mushrooms, 1 extra onion, extra garlic and italian sausage."
2002102095,83950,2018-04-08,5,My kids are fussy eaters....and OMG they both finished this pasta and even suggested me to open a restaurant.......this recipe is so awesomeeeee
2002107585,83950,2018-04-11,0,Add a tsp of cinnamon. I was letting it simmer and thought it was just not interesting enough. Adding a few more pepper flakes (I like hot) but then also added the cinnamon. You won't &quot;taste&quot; it with your mouth but instead with your nose as you consume. Enjoy!
2002126055,83950,2018-04-22,5,"I have made this twice in the last three weeks. I could not bring myself to put sage and nutmeg in sauce, but did everything else exactly as the recipe directed. It is the best bolognese I have ever made and will never go back to my old recipe."
2001565710,83950,2018-07-26,4,I used Italian pancetta for authenticity and also cream instead of milk. I used San Marzano plum tomatoes as they r flavorful:) I also threw in fresh oregano &amp; basil near the end. Great recipe!
2002317134,83950,2018-10-30,5,"This is an excellent bolognese sauce. I agree with another comment here where they recommended using pancetta instead of bacon. It definitely adds authenticity to the sauce. Do not omit the nutmeg. It adds a subtle, wonderful flavour. I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground pork (personal preference). I also cut the milk down to 2/3 cup. An excellent recipe that I will make again, and definitely recommend."
2002319670,83950,2018-11-02,5,I have been making this sauce for about 2 years. It is by far the best i have ever found. I double the onions and carrots and agree pancetta is better than the bacon but the bacon is great as well and you should cook the bacon first. take it out and just leave a little of the fat to mix with butter and olive oil and then chop up the bacon and put it back in. Cream is good but i like it both ways. Double the recipe so you have some for the whole week. My teenage kids love it and they don't love a lot...eccezionale!
74652,70099,2003-09-19,5,Wow!  I love Cold Sesame noodles and this was really good!  I ommited the cucumber and bean sprouts (did not have the cucumber and dont care for bean sprouts) and it was still great!  I sprinkled some sesame seeds over the top with the Cilantro and it looked really pretty!  Great salad for a BBQ or Picnic! Thanks for sharing!
86318,70099,2003-12-06,4,"Let me start by saying that I like this salad very much. I made it once in October without some necessary ingredients, so I couldn't give it a rating then. I finally got around to making it today. I used all of the ingredients listed, but instead of grating the carrot and cucumber, I cut them into julienne strips similar to the bean sprouts. I liked the sauce and cilantro with the rice noodles, and think the honey is an especially nice touch. Actually, the only problem I had was the amount of green onion. The recipe is for 6 servings, but I just can't imagine using that much raw green onion. Maybe your green onions are a lot smaller than ours. I did use about one fourth of a cup, and am thinking of cutting that back next time. Thank you for this recipe, Island Girl. "
71613,70099,2004-04-27,3,"This was alright but my salad turned out extremely watery and I squeezed out the water from the cucumber and carrots after grating.  Not sure what I did wrong but I think it would have tasted better had my rice noodles absorbed the flavoring.  
Although this might have been my fault...I bought my fave rice noodles which don't go mushy in water, perhaps ordinary rice noodles would have been more appropriate.  Tasted fine though!"
209747,70099,2006-04-10,4,"Great flavors in this. I grated the veggies as directed but I think that they would be better in a little bit bigger pieces, at least the cucumber. The amount of noodles to veggies seemed a little off- would have liked less noodles or more veggies. I added about a tablespoon of chopped fresh mint to this as well- I love mint in asian foods- and have it growing so it was very convenient to throw in. Thanks for sharing island girl!"
457321,70099,2007-11-01,5,"This was such a big hit in my house that 2 days later we made it again, but this time added chicken that had been chopped, marinated in some of the same Asian flavors, and then stir-fried.  If you allow the chicken to cool and then mix it in, the salad becomes a meal on its own.  Great recipe!"
118163,67547,2003-12-30,5,"Oh my god!!! I can't believe how good these beans were! LOL. I made these for a family get-together when I had the 2 days to make it, and wow, it was so worth it. Thank you so much for this recipe. I will be making it again!"
23479,67547,2004-01-18,4,"Hey Rockinchef, your beans are superb. I did cut back on the chili powder, from 5 tbls to 3 tbls. Really delicious."
700782,67547,2007-12-23,5,"This recipe is amazing! I have been looking for a good baked beans recipe for over a year now and this is it!

I made some modifications: 3 tbl chili powder; I also added about 1/4 of a cup of pure maple syrup; cooked in a dutch oven."
463954,67547,2009-06-04,4,"The taste is great, I too cut back on the chili powder BUT I have a problem with the basic recipe in that it doesn't specify the SIZE of the package of beans.  I finally went with a two pound package and it seemed to work.  The package size should be correctly stated in the recipe."
1585511,67547,2010-04-27,5,"Wow these were really good!  I'm not a huge bean maker so I got confused in certain parts like are you suppose to boil the beans for 1 1/2 hours?  Anyway besides having to cook these a lot lot lot longer than it said, there's definitely no need for us to buy the expensive bush's beans anymore!"
742955,67547,2010-11-23,2,"Very frustrated that the amounts of some main ingredients were not specified in the recipe and now I wish I would have left this recipe alone. I used the amount of beans another cook suggested (2 pounds) which I found to be far too many. The beans took hours longer to cook, a lot more water and the flavor wasn't that great. If you decide to add the amount of beans and bacon to use I will try it again, RockinChef. This information seems pretty important and I'm not sure how everyone else got this to turn out so well."
1361960,67547,2012-07-11,5,"VERY GOOD!! I made a tripple batch for a BBQ-Party! Delicious, Thanks for the recipe. I will definitely use it many more times! I made it in a slow cooker, turned out wonderful! I used a little less brown sugar and chili powder and I put some chili paste in it to give it a little more pep!"
2000074125,67547,2015-03-20,4,"Delicious! Had more of a stag chili flavor compared to the original bush&#039;s baked beans but we quite enjoyed these baked beans and I will save this recipe to use again. Didn&#039;t get the same texture as Bush&#039;s, but still good. I used a 2 lb bag of Great Northern Beans and that worked well - made about 3 Litres in the end. I baked it for a little longer than it said too."
2001063105,67547,2016-06-25,1,"While the taste was great, know that at high altitude you have to more than quadruple the water. I did not know this, so the water evaporated in less than two hours and the resulting mess on the pans was catastrophic. I managed to save one pyrex dish, but the other was beyond repair, even armed with a variety of extra strength cleaners and steel wool. Bottom line, use disposable pans. Also, if you are at high altitude (I live at 7K feet), I would skip this recipe completely. You can't ever get the beans to cook no matter how much water you add, and the resulting mess makes it completely not worth it."
2000360876,67547,2016-08-17,4,Its one lb dried northern beans everyone give it a try that way.
1680722,503475,2014-03-15,5,"Today we had a late breakfast and we found that it would nice to have something smaller for lunch. After a short search in Kato&#039;s recipe I found that this is the perfect recipe.&lt;br/&gt;I prepared this this for 4 peoples and we all enjoyed it very much ... it was so good in 15 minutes all was gone!&lt;br/&gt;The recipe was perfect, the dough had the right consistence even after the minor change I did using milk instead of cream.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks a lot for this dessert/snack! :)"
227978,503475,2017-08-29,5,"My goodness, this is one delicious baked pancake. The cinnamon/sugar mixture was just enough to sweeten the apples but not so sweet as to make it seem like a dessert. I bought enough apples to make a whole batch, but my apple supply seemed to have mysteriously dwindled to only 2 when it was time to make this recipe. So I made 1/3 recipe and baked it in my small (8-inch) cast iron skillet, and it made enough for 3 large portions (could even get by with 4 portions for smaller appetites). I have a hot spot in my oven and I kept turning my skillet to keep it from browning too fast. Despite my efforts, the edge all around seemed to have scorched a tad. But nonetheless it still tasted wonderful. I'd happily serve this Danish Apple Pancake to company or even for a special occasion, because it's much better than a plain pancake and makes breakfast a special occasion. Thanks, Baby Kato.

895132,303460,2010-09-11,5,Excellent blend of flavors! I used apple cider vinegar and added a little honey and marinated the meat for about 30 hours. Will make this again! Thanks for posting.<br/>Made for Diabetic Tailgate Party.
895132,303457,2010-09-11,5,"Definitely five stars! I understand that ""fruit vinegar"" was meant to be fruit juice, so I used a mix of pineapple and lime and added 1 teaspoon honey. I added the lime leaves with the lemon grass and let the meat marinate for about 30 hours. Will make this again! Thanks for posting.<br/>Made for Diabetic Tailgate Party."
64642,52804,2003-03-23,5,"A lovely, light little cake just perfect for the two of us.  I used the juice from the pineapple for the water.  Very easy and quick to make.  Will be making it again."
45999,52804,2004-06-09,5,"A very easy and quick cake to make.  I, too, used the juice from the pineapple in place of the water.  This cake was extremely moist and enjoyed by all.  I iced it with a cream cheese icing."
38218,52804,2004-07-11,5,"Lovely cake!  I also used the pineapple juice.  I haven't seen a Jiffy cake in years.  Corn bread, yes, but the stores in my area don't stock Jiffy CAKES.  I used half a regular Betty Crocker mix.  The cake came out perfect.  I frosted it with cream cheese frosting #68975 cut down to 1/4.  It's almost gone.  DH is thrilled (he ate most of it).  I was hoping it would be dessert for two days at least."
103809,52804,2004-09-04,2,"Sorry, we didn't particularly like this."
308765,52804,2007-04-03,0,"According to crenita2 on the yahoo ricecooker recipe group, this recipe can be made in a rice cooker! She mentions: ""Grease the rice cooker pan well- I put a piece of parchment paper on the bottom of the pan. Mix together the cake mix, pudding, nutmeg and cinnamon. 
Add eggs, oil and water to this mixture with mixer for about 1 minutes. (I did it by hand)
Add the pineapple, carrots, pecans and coconut. Blend well. pour into pan and hit cook. takes about 30-40 minutes."""
469437,52804,2007-10-22,5,We made this in the rice cooker and it was great! It took about 1.5 cycles of the cooker to get the doneness we wanted. I also used coconut cream pudding mix because we didn't have vanilla. We topped it with some store bought cream cheese frosting. We'll definitely be making this again. Perfect size too! Thanks Barb!
422893,52804,2012-04-09,5,"Yum, yum, this is definitely lovely & moist & tastes great, really easy to make too. I got 6 cupcakes & one round cake from this mix, subbed flaked almonds for the pecans and left out the nutmeg only because I didn't have any. Thanks for posting!"
2676919,52804,2013-02-04,5,Thanks for the Carrot cake rice cooker recipe! I've been looking for it for a long time and I will definitely try it. :)
539686,251021,2008-06-21,5,This tastes great and looks beautiful. Made for ZWT 4's trip to Africa. I'd say it served closer to 4 with the addition of about a 1/3 glass of the lemonade to cut the alcoholic level. Very good party beverage!
61660,251021,2008-07-30,5,"I really loved this!  So refreshing, especially after a long day of work. I made it on a Thursday night so Friday when I got home it was just sitting in my fridge waiting for me!!  Loved the peach flavor and did add a little extra peach to each of the glasses and about 1/4 cup lemonade.   Once again Boomette, thanks for a great recipe!"
284180,251021,2009-09-25,5,"So fresh and delicious!  I love the peach flavor!  I made a couple of changes:  left out the peach puree, so I split the vodka between citron and peach to make up for the peach flavor.  And I filled with diet lemon-lime soda instead of lemonade, to cut the calories and add a bit of fizz.  This turned out really yummy."
226863,251021,2010-11-28,5,Great sangria!  Used diet sprite instead of lemonade to cut calories....otherwise made as posted.  Thoroughly enjoyed on a football watching day!  Thanks for sharing.
110034,38798,2004-08-03,4,"Very nice way to get your greens.  I will cut the spinach down by half a box and use a bit less oregano next time.  I baked some as balls but then tried putting the mixture in mini muffin cups, which worked well too.  Thanks for another spinach treat for my repetoire!"
125798,38798,2005-01-07,3,"I liked these - great flavor!  But they seemed more like ""breadballs"" to me.  I guess the name, ""I can't believe it's spinach"" is accurate, as I could hardly taste the spinach, but was looking forward to tasting it at least a little...  I added some fresh basil, and that added great ""umph"" to the taste factor."
487548,38798,2008-04-03,4,I found this a very good recipe.  Easy and nutritionally good if a bit bland.  I used fresh basil 3X the amount in the recipe as it didn't specify dried or fresh.  Next time (and there will be some) I think I will add a bit of grated Parmesan cheese to the mix.  Just a bit so it wont overpower.
114243,523359,2015-09-05,0,"This recipe is almost exactly like firemandave&#039;s version, even down to some of the same wording in the instructions. What a strange coincidence. LOL 
http://www.food.com/recipe/wienerschnitzel-chili-as-close-as-you-will-find-466215
I&#039;ll have to give your adaptation a try and see how it compares to his. I really like his recipe and so does my family. We don&#039;t have wienerschnitzel where I live, but we&#039;ve visited them in other states and their chili-dogs are amazing! :) I can&#039;t give any stars yet because I haven&#039;t tried your adaptation, but when I do I&#039;ll come back and rate it. :)"
52448,141939,2006-04-11,5,"Very good crispy and spiced chicken. Followed the recipe exact but not for the temperature, a lot lower then the 425F. I had potatoes in the oven at 350F and baked the chicken at the same temperature for one hour. It came out very browned, crispy and tender. Will use that temperature again next time since it turned out great this way! "
313633,141939,2006-09-07,5,The chicken was great. The whole family loved it and requested it again.This was another great recipe from Kitten cal thanks so much.
128473,141939,2006-11-14,5,"Wonderful chicken Kitten...it has amazing flavour and crisped up beautifully. It is well worth the extra effort. I will be making this again often...my dh...declared the chicken excellent and has already requested it be made again for this weekend. I used legs this time, but next time I will make this with breasts, thights and legs.  Thanks so much for sharing."
503619,141939,2007-07-26,5,"I made this recipe tonight,   doubled everything & used the butter flavored pam at the end instead of butter.  Because it was 90+ degrees in so. Ca. All day, I cooked it on the b-b-q.  Pre-heated for 30 minutes while the chicken ""rested"" on the racks & cooked it for the 45 min.
It was unbelievable!  So moist & the coating was really flavorfull!
Thanks for sharing!  This is truly a keeper!
Lani in ca."
804887,141939,2009-07-15,5,Very flavorful and crispy. Great recipe!
1242092,141939,2011-07-20,0,"I was very hopeful that this would be yummy, as I adore most of Kittencal's recipes.  But....  even though I made this exactly as written, we didn't like it at all.  The thyme overpowered everything.  We baked it on a rack as directed but the bottom of the chicken was goopy and gross."
231736,171442,2010-06-10,4,"This was good and easy because of not having to cook the sauce first, but not very barbecue-y.  I think I would like this better with regular spareribs instead of the babybacks, although that would need a longer cooking time, and probably pre-cooking to get some of the fat off."
22973,43026,2003-05-22,5,"Grandma Pam,
  Oh my goodness,these were so easy to do,and they were so very good. We dipped them in salsa,and they were a hit with my husband.
Thank you so much!!!

41578,43026,2003-06-12,5,"WOW!  When you need a Mexican fix, this is the recipe to try.  These are so easy to make and really hit the spot!  I love the idea of being able to prepare them ahead of time.  Thank you for sharing this.  :-)
"
44372,43026,2004-02-18,5,"OMG!  If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars I would!  I loved the ease of prep, and the flavor was awesome!  I wasn't sure which size can to use, and realized that 1 4 oz was not nearly enough...it only had 3 chiles in it. hehe  So I would recommend at least 3 of those.  I made up a green gravy to serve with these as well that I will be posting.  Deeeeelicious!!!"
142658,43026,2004-06-04,5,"I have been searching for this recipe.  My husbands aunt made these once and we all loved them. I loved the simplicity of the egg roll wrapper!

Thanks for posting.  I probably won't make often b/c I don't ever fry things - but I am so glad to finally have the recipe.  These are yummy!"
133625,43026,2004-07-03,5,"How easy and yummy!  I am always looking for a do ahead recipe.  My DH and I ate them for supper but what a fabulous appetizer to share. Thanks! 
 "
162119,43026,2005-02-23,5,"As coincidence would have it, I am certain that I know what restaurant this recipe is referring to, as I frequented the place for many years and always ordered the chilis rellenos.  I was sad to see the restaurant close its doors as it was a common hang-out for my group of friends, but I have tried this recipe and it does a great job of duplicating those crispy ""gringo"" style rellenos.  Be sure to eat them while they are crispy- if you let them sit they will get soggy.  They are especially great when served with a smothering of green chile!"
139760,43026,2005-03-12,5,"Wow, so easy and really great!  After the first two, we didn't roll them in the cornstarch, and really couldn't tell any difference.  We also started thinking about what we could add to give them more zip and what else we could put in egg roll wrappers.  My 17 year old son kept eating and eating them!  Thanks!"
230318,43026,2005-07-20,5,I just started posting reviews but I should have a long time ago for this recipe. I have made these at least 5 times. Delicious.
173443,43026,2005-09-18,5,"I think the egroll wrapper idea is GENIOUS.I made a few small changes.I used fresh poblanos,instead of canned chiles.I sauteed the poblanos with tomatoes,onion and cilantro,and seasoned them with Goya Sazon.I used over-sized spring roll wrappers.I used 2 spring rolls at a time (to keep all of the juicy peppers inside),I put 1 slice of muenster cheese on the wrapper,added a heaping spoon of the pepper filling,added a slice of cheese on top,and rolled it up tightly.I sealed it with a small dab of flour-water paste,so it stayed sealed while frying.These were so quick to put together and everyone DEVOURED them.Whoever made up this idea of putting them inside a wrapper was brilliant.Authentic Chile Rellenos are a pain to make,and these have all of the flavor without the aggravion of peeling the peppers,whipping the egg batter and so on.Thanks!!"
405868,43026,2006-12-12,5,"Chile rellenos are my favorite mexican food! My boyfriend and I only like the crispy ones so this recipe was perfect!!! I have to agree, the egg roll wrappers are probably the smartest idea ever came up with!!! It works so well and tastes so delicious. what cheese have u all found to be the best? The mexican restaurant I go to uses mozarella. OK well this is soooo delicious!!"
221044,43026,2006-12-18,5,"*Wonderful!*  Definately need to buy the LARGE wonton wrappers, and use pepper-jack cheese for flavor.  SOOO easy and delicious.  I served over a pool of left-over enchilada sauce (Recipe #132058) and some left-over Cilantro Creme & salsa (Recipe #125221).  As you can tell, I was ""Jonesing"" for Mexican food all weekend.  THANKS so much for a MUCH simpler and delightful Relleno recipe.  I'll actually MAKE them more often, now that they don't take an hour to construct!"
515278,43026,2007-07-23,4,These were pretty good.  I liked the ease of preparation.  You could also buy mild diced green chilies and grated cheese and put them in won ton wrappers for small appetizers.
416758,43026,2008-02-19,5,"I made mine more or less the way Chef #173443 made hers - and OMG LOOK OUT! I don't think there's much you could do wrong with these, esp if you include cheese! I made these twice this week - once fried and once brushed with oil and put under the broiler (flipped once). Both worked out great! WILL MAKE THIS ONE OFTEN, THANKS!!"
415551,43026,2009-01-15,5,"Oh wow, I remember having this at a little place in Denver called the something Street Dairy YEARS AGO.  They sold for like 90 cents a pop and were sooo good.  It's an authentic Colorado recipe for sure. Thanks CC!"
750280,43026,2009-02-08,0,"I am pretty sure I know which Mexican restaurant in Colorado..I am from Colorado too..(Grand Junction, CO) and if its the same restaurant I know of..I am crushed that they are out of business..? Anyway  these chili rellenos were baked (or maybe the ""warmed up"" enchilada sauce was just poured over the chili relleno) in a mild enchilada sauce (after initial frying) and before serving..and they were the best...I am so glad that Colorado Cookie shared this recipe"
1436178,43026,2009-11-04,5,"I grew up eating these on Football sundays. We used to fry up hundreds for the game and there would never be any leftovers.  Being from CO this is the only chile relleno that I love!  They are SUPER EASY to make.  Super easy to eat. When I was really small my mom didn't put the chile in some just for us kids.  Instead we got a whole lot of cheese.  We used to use monterey jack and/or cheddar.  I prefer pepperjack now because it adds a little extra something to them.  We never used cornstarch (I am guessing that is to keep them from sticking together when made ahead of time).  But they turn out fantastic.  If you are looking for an easy appetizer recipe or just something different these are SOOOOO worth it!
They taste great on their own but any kind of mexican dip/sauce would probably make these that much more yummy!
Happy Eating!"
126440,43026,2009-11-06,5,Loved this recipe.  I only made four as an appetizer with a freshly roasted chili and pepper jack cheese.  Served it with Recipe #95632.
1539827,43026,2010-02-01,0,"I will give these a try.  I've made them, but not with cornstarch.

I'm from colorado, and the Best Chile Tellenos I've ever had is from Gordo's.  It use to be on colfax, then it went to 6th and Sheridan, now it's at 44th and Wadsword.  BEST CHILE RELLENOS IN TOWN!

...I can never get them as good, though.."
329638,43026,2010-10-06,5,"These were awesome!  I used fresh poblanos, roasted and peeled, and should have brined them, as they needed the punch of the brine, but they were still fantastic.  Thanks for sharing one of our new addictions!"
1951766,43026,2011-07-08,5,"Yum!  We're making rellenos tonight and LOVE the egg roll wrappers!  Haven't used cornstarch yet but I'm excited to try it tonight.  We usually use colby jack, mild/medium cheddar AND cream cheese!  Adding cream cheese to our rellenos makes them out of this world delicious!"
2711064,43026,2013-02-25,0,"I used to work at a Mexican Food Resteraunt in Littleton when I was in High School that is now out of business.  I worked in the kitchen and this recepi is very similar to what we used to make.  I'm not sure if they used egg roll wraps as our chili rellenos were actually prepared by someone in the family and brought in frozen several times a week.  I have been trying to replicate their recepi and never thought of egg roll wraps but that makes sense.  I'm going to try it tonight.  And we covered ours in home made green chili and garneshed with chopped lettuce.  Oh the resteraunt started with ""Mission"""
2001290680,43026,2017-03-14,0,"This is exactly what I was looking for. I worked in a little Mexican restaurant in Ovid, Colorado in the mid 2000's; we used Monterey Jack cheese and the egg roll wrappers. One canned whole chile, one small slice of cheese (maybe 1/4 inch thick and 1.5x3 inches or so), moisten the edges and fold into little &quot;envelopes.&quot; I miss those things! They my favorite after-work meal: 2 CR's with just a little green chili, a heaping helping of guacamole and some sour cream. A 16 year old's dream! Lol."
56181,70005,2003-09-13,5,"These were very easy to make and very tasty!  It doesn't say how many tomatoes to use, but I used about 5.  I also didn't have the fresh spices on hand so I used about 1 tsp of garlic salt, 1 tsp basil, and 1 tsp of oregano, put them together in a ziploc baggie and ran my rolling pin over it a few times to make the spices extra fine.  Anyway, this was a great way to use up some extra tomatoes and I will definitely make again!"
60989,70005,2003-10-14,5,"Perfect. Easy, taste is wonderful, a snap to make! Wonderful way to use up my extra tomatoes. I have the extras in olive oil in the fridge. I had to use dried seasonings, because I didn't have any fresh on hand.  I will definitally be making these again! "
56463,70005,2004-05-11,5,"I don't know why I didn't review these before-I'm on my second batch! They are great, I use the grape tomatoes, cut them in half and don't worry about removing the seeds. They don't take as long to dry, and I store them in the refrigerator with a little olive oil. Thanks for a great way to keep tomatoes that might otherwise get old and have to be thrown out. Carole in Orlando"
37036,70005,2004-06-06,5,This recipe is so easy and the tomatoes turned out great!  I baked them for 6 hours and used fresh basil (from the garden) and 1 teaspoon dried oregano.  I have two tomato plants that are loaded down with tomatoes and this was the perfect recipe to help use them up.  I will definitely use this recipe again!  
174547,70005,2004-11-26,5,"These were so easy to make.  I also used grape tomatoes.  Instead of using the oven, I used my food dehydrator and this worked great.  I dehydrated some of them until they were crunchy.  Great just to throw on salads or just eat as a snack.  Thanks for posting."
101034,70005,2005-07-03,5,"These were fabulous!! I used 6 tomatoes and baked them for 5 hours. I needed them for a recipe, but I couldn't stop munching on them, they tasted so good!!! I'll never use the store bought again. Thanks for a keeper.  "
8377,70005,2005-08-27,0,"These are great. I baked them overnight for a total of 14-hours. My tomatoes were huge and very meaty, so I quartered them. I could not stop popping them in my mouth as I was taking them out of the oven.I am storing them in the fridge in a jar of olive oil and garlic. This will make a delicious tomato pesto. Thanks for such a nice recipe, Gerry."
126602,70005,2005-08-31,5,"Not enough stars for this recipe.  I used large meaty tomatoes, so total oven time was 12 hours.  I ate a few when they were done and preserved the rest in olive oil in the fridge.  I think next time I will use roma or large cherry tomatoes to cut down on drying time.  These are so worth the wait...next batch will be  a quadruple at least!!!"
49304,70005,2005-09-01,5,"Delicious, easy to make. I used several kinds of tomatoes, Roma's, large red, yellow and large cherry. The roma's & cherry tomatoes did the best for drying time, 6 hours. The larger tomatoes had a long way to go so we ate them with our dinner, YUMMY. I used extra virgin olive oil, fresh basil, doubled the amount of garlic and didn't use the oregano, personal preference.Then packed then into a small jar with extra virgin oil to preserve them & stored in refrigerator. I plan to make more as soon as I have more ripe roma's these would make a good snack. Thanks for posting this yummy recipe."
298447,70005,2015-10-10,5,"Delicious!  I had a bunch of campari tomatoes that i had to use up or else.  So, i just drizzled and sprinkled ingredients (no fresh basil or oregano, so used dried) to what i felt &quot;looked&quot; right/good.  Also, I was short on time, so i adjusted temp of oven to 250 to cut down on cooking time (i guess it took me about 3 hours for my batch).  Turned out delicious (even the few that were a little overdone).  They are so good, we&#039;ve been eating them like potato chips...but next time, will be sure to keep some on hand for recipes, etc.  So yummy...thank you!"
55221,70005,2005-10-10,5,"It's great to have an alternative to canning for my abundant tomato harvest! These, with their intensely sweet tomato taste, are better than Craisins! I liked setting the prepared tomatoes cut-side up so that they functioned as miniature bowls. The ""little bowls"" then contained the olive oil and herbs (mostly dried basil with a light touch of course-ground garlic salt) which gradually infused into the tomatoes during dehydration. It took the smaller tomatoes ('Fox' large cherry-type and 'Principe Borghese' Italian drying tomatoes) 6 hours and the larger ('Viva Italia' paste-type) 8+ hours to complete the drying process. Thanks for providing great instructions for homemade ""Sun Dried"" Tomatoes!"
251414,70005,2005-11-10,5,"I went to the Houston Farmer's Market and bought pounds and pounds of very ripe tomatoes for $.50 per pound. Spent a little time prepping them for this recipe with dried and fresh herbs mixed with lemon juice and lotsa garlic. My large Roma tomatoes took 5 hours in a dehydrating toaster oven and BOY did my house smell great the whole time! I put the tomatoes in olive oil with feta cheese chunks and peppercorns, and had a real feast with the tomato/feta mixture eaten with fresh french bread slices. Yummy! "
189643,70005,2005-11-28,4,"This makes a great snack; sweet and intense, as another reviewer said. I made these in my dehydrator at 155 degrees for 5 hours. I used 8 small tomatoes, but would recommend using a lot more tomatoes to go with the 4 Tbsp of herbs. I found it a little difficult to measure the herbs but not the tomatoes, so I just used fresh garlic and dried basil and oregano to my tastes.  I really enjoyed eating these, and will probably add some in stew or italian casseroles. Thanks for a different and delicious use for tomatoes!"
259966,70005,2006-04-01,5,These are fabulous. Forgot to buy sun dried tomatoes but had just bought fresh vine-ripened at Costco so I checked out this recipe and was not disappointed. Ate half of them as I removed them from the oven. Some got a little crunchy and were delicious. Now I will make my barley lentil soup with sun dried tomatoes. I will use this recipe again for sure. THANKS
54697,70005,2006-07-11,5,"In my opinion, these are better than chocolate and maybe better than sex.  Wow!  What a way to use up crop of tomatoes.  Thanks."
79997,70005,2006-07-23,0,"The grocers won't like you...   Imagine.  Giving a simple, wonderful recipe that will be used over and over again and for just pennies on the dollar.  I am so pleased that you posted this.  It will get passed on to family and friends.  Thank you so much.
"
265073,70005,2006-08-30,5,"Wow!  These were awesome.  I used grape tomatoes cut in half, baked it for 2 hours and broiled it for 30 mins, then served it in a chicken and garlic sauce over pasta.  Everybody loved it!"

382999,70005,2007-05-20,5,"This is an outstanding recipe that is a great solution for using up tomatoes when you have far too many!  Of course, you can just buy tomatoes specifically to have dried tomatoes on hand.  The herbs, garlic and olive oil add good flavor.  I'll be making this during the summer when my tomatoes are yielding their fruits (should be a lot!)."
131674,70005,2007-07-30,5,I have a large abundance of Roma tomatoes this year and this recipe helped us use them up.  Very easy to do and my kitchen smelled wonderful.  I love using fresh herbs and garlic on these.  Thanks!
353381,70005,2007-09-27,5,"These are so dang good!  Very addicting!  Thanks for the great recipe, we needed a way to use up some of the tomatoes from the garden."
11176,70005,2008-08-07,4,"Without knowing how many tomatoes to use, I settled on 7 medium-sized beauties. The end result was a tad over-seasoned; I think about 10-11 tomatoes of this size would have been perfect for me. I baked them for 6 hours and they were still a little wet to the touch, so I put them in the dehydrator overnight on a low setting and they came out nice. I had them in a pasta and prosciutto with arugula pesto last night and we both had seconds. Oh, the aroma... ~*inhales deeply*~ YUM! :) Thanks for the lovely recipe!"
331472,70005,2009-09-12,5,"Wonderful, thanks!"
231057,70005,2011-08-29,5,"Another great review for a great recipe!  I put all the ""cleaned"" tomato pieces in a big bowl and drizzled with the olive oil and seasonings, then laid them out on the foil lined cookie sheet (quicker for me).  Loved the aroma in the house while these were baking and they are so good.  Put the pieces in small baggies for the freezer for future use also.  (This is an experiment on my part - I have never frozen sun dried tomatoes.)  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!"
1666717,70005,2013-09-15,4,"This was a vary easy recipe. I used three different types of cherry tomatoes (yellow pear, sun sugar, and red cherry) and a food dehydrator instead of the oven they took about 12 hours to dry. They turned out awesome and we ended up doing about 2 gallons of tomatoes."
2204364,475785,2012-03-07,5,Delicious!!!!! -- the goat cheese made the difference.  My new favorite meatloaf.
2216720,475785,2012-03-21,5,"What a fabulous recipe. I have a lot of friends who either love to cook, are cookbook authors, are on TV with a cooking show, or who have been featured on cooking shows, so I know a thing or two about cooking. I know, for instance that cooking offers up a continual stream of adventures that do not require a passport or long airline layovers. Cooking is creative, expressive and comforting. A form of open eyed meditation lifting one beyond the commonplace. I'm a vegetarian, but I love to visit other recipes for inspiration so that I can use them by adapting the meat ingredients and therefore adopting them into my favorite recipe file.  All thumbs up for this recipe by an obviously gifted, dedicated and creative cook!"
618715,293836,2009-04-25,4,"This was pretty good, but very salty because of the amount of chicken soup base. I'll try this again with either chicken stock or less chicken soup base. Thanks!"
2002282614,293836,2018-09-23,5,"I was raised in Worcester, MA where Hannah Kalajian first produced the Near East Rice Pilaf and it was superb. Since it has been sold, what is offered in the boxes today is flavorless. When I saw this recipe and looked at the ingredients, I was hopeful it would be as good as the original. Well today I made it and it was AWESOME! Just the right amount of Chicken powder, garlic powder and turmeric. THANK YOU SO MUCH!"
128835,95534,2005-02-15,5,"Made this this past weekend.  Hubby's comment was: ""now this is my kind food."" I cut tabasco down to 1/2 tsp. and added no extra salt.  Thanks for a real good recipe"
305442,95534,2006-03-26,5,"I lived in Des Plaines, IL. for 31 years and now live in Kentucky.  I grew up loving Italian Beefs and make sure to get one every time I visit home.  This recipe was easy and the most authentic.  It was great to have a taste and smell of Chicago in my kitchen.  Thanks!"
95210,95534,2006-04-26,5,I made this last year for my son's graduation party and it was a big hit.  Used two roasts and cooked in an electric roasrer.  I was able to make it two days ahead and just reheat for the party.  Definately be making again for this years graduation!
284922,95534,2006-05-01,5,"I have not had a home made sandwich this good in a very long time!  I didn't change a thing, and it was absolutely perfect... very full of flavor!  Thanks so much for posting this recipe, we will enjoy it quite often :)"
185446,95534,2006-07-29,5,"Very easy and tasty!  A good company lunch recipe--you'll enjoy it because it was made ahead of time, and they'll enjoy eating a top notch sandwich.  I especially liked the optional gravy that can be spooned on per  individual tastebuds.  Thanks EdsGirlAngie!   "
358086,95534,2006-09-30,5,"Delicious! I grew up in ""Chicagoland"" and moved to the desert southwest--NO  Chicago-style Italian beef anywhere.   I used 2 cans of beef broth plus about 1/2 c. of water instead of the bouillon.  This tastes like Carm's Italian Beef--thank you for this great recipe!"
1025092,95534,2008-11-13,5,"The best ... better than all of the chicago italian beefs I had during my 30 years of living in chicago.  We live in florida and they have nothing like this.  We made it at home and even my husband who is from the northeast and never ""appreciated"" how great chicago italian beef is ... he's now in love with it and just bought a big rump roast so we can make a huge batch ... awesome recipe ... thanks!!!!"
357358,95534,2006-12-30,5,"Perfection. Am glad I doubled the gravy because it was good for dipping the sandwich like a French Dip. All my guests on Christmas day loved ""da Best"" beef. Next time I will double the garlic and try thickening the gravy a bit with cornstarch as this would make an excellent open face sandwich over Italian bread. The thinner your slices, the better. The thin slices were tender but the thicker slices needed to be shredded because they were chewier. Now I have to buy a new slicer for next time! Thanks Angie. 12/29/2006 - Made this again. Just had to try it with a cheaper pot roast cut. Great flavor but a bit more difficult to slice. That is ok because I am going to shred it up and use in Recipe #195266. Folks, if you like beef, you have to try this recipe. Everytime I go in the kitchen, someone has their head in the fridge and is sneeking a piece of beef out of the dish!"
438906,95534,2007-01-27,5,"What a great Recipe!  Thank you to EdsGirlAngie for taking the time to give such clear and easy instructions.  The way the roast marinates overnite in ""da Gravy"" makes it!  My husband used to eat Italian Beef in Chicago all the time and we have been searching for a recipe!  He loves this one.  I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and used beef broth instad of bouillon cubes (bouillon cubes have added MSG in them and you can purchased beef broth without any added MSG).  I think doubling ""da Gravy"" is a great idea too.  This recipe makes a ton--you could feed alot of people!!"
439818,95534,2007-01-28,5,"Excellent recipe!  It was my mother-in-law's b-day today.  We had called in an order at Luke's Beef in Phoenix, AZ yesterday to bring to her house today.  They couldn't fill the order.  My husband and I didn't know what to do.  I found this recipe and made it last night to eat today.  Everyone LOVED it! THANKS for sharing!  The beef had a great flavor and you can adjust the ""heat"" by the amount of tabasco you add.  I'd recommend this recipe!"
436502,95534,2007-03-02,5,"I made this recipe for a superbowl party. I roasted the beef, and sliced it very thin allmost shaved on a slicer. I even ordered some giardiniera relish on line to go with it.  I live in atlanta and everybody loved it, most having Itlian beef for the first time. Moving here from Chicago, I thought it tasted like the real thing! Too bad the Da Bears lost the Super Bowl.  I am going to make this whenever I get homesick for the midwest.  Do ya got any recipes for cheese fries??????????"
287998,95534,2007-03-05,5,"Delicious, tender, flavorful and not 8.00 a pound. I wish I had a deli slicer to really do it justice ! I followed the directions except for more garlic."
440047,95534,2007-05-20,4,"Not my favorite, I'm not a huge meat eater. But my husband really liked it. Next time I will slice it thinner. Thank you."
399166,95534,2007-07-01,5,"We live in Ohio now, but grew up in Chicago. The italian beef and pizza are what brings us back to visit! We made this and it was awesome! We have changed it up a bit and added it to our menu in our restaurant. Thaks for the recipe!"
251944,95534,2007-07-23,5,"We had a ""Chicago Night"" with my dinner club and I made this recipe.  The beef was amazing!  I doubled the gravy and shaved it very thin.  We had some left over  and my famly loved it too! I also loved that most of the work is done way before the guests arrive. Thanks for the sharing a great recipe."
51109,95534,2007-07-29,5,"Oh, Angie, this is so good!  I divided and shared with my daughter's family since 5 pounds of beef is a bit much for just me, freezer or not!  No rump roasts to be found at my grocers, but eye of round roasts were on sale so I used one of those.  The cooking time was less because it was much smaller in diameter, but the meat was perfect.  The only ""if"" for me was that I thought the oregano was a little strong in the gravy, but apparently I was the only one who thought so.  My grandson called me today to say, ""I really, really love your steak, Grandma! But would you make me some more of the soup?  We ran out and I love it!""  Thanks for such a delicious recipe, Angie!  My grandson will make sure it's made often....."
182358,95534,2007-08-26,5,"Wow!  Is this good...  Had a 3# round roast (on special) but followed the recipe exactly b/c I wanted to be sure I had enough of ""da gravy""...  Couldn't be easier to make and it's delicious!  Made Recipe #97096 for the rolls and it was just perfect.  Definitely a repeat recipe around here.  Looking forward to leftovers this week!  Thanks, Angie!"
233583,95534,2007-11-07,4,"Well came home from a seminar week and then of course had to cook for the next day. This was my chosen recipe and let me tell you it was flavorful, moist and tender.  I LOVED it.  Simplicity and delicious all at the same time. It was nice to have dinner ready just to be reheated when I got home from a first day back in the school. The flavors melded nicely, nothing stood out over anything else but you felt so comfortable eating and enjoyed.  It was also nice as it was our first snow fall of the season and this is a meal you really want as the snow falls and the cold settles around outside.The gravy was also great over mashed potatoes.  Served on crusty rolls. I did half the Tobasco as I cannot eat HOT things. I did leave on the table for DH to add to his at choice.  He did not, said it was good as is.  I think I will try this in the crock over the weekend and see how that works out. Great football party food.
This is a keeper."
721892,95534,2008-01-09,5,Awsome!
502509,95534,2008-02-03,4,Do NOT overcook! DH used the thermometer's guide for rare and the meat was overcooked and very tough. Will make again and will follow recipe closely next time
158086,95534,2008-02-04,5,"great tasting meat, mine was  a little overdone, but when I warmed it up in the sauce it got very tender and tasty..."
762866,95534,2008-02-13,5,Wonderful! Great flavor.  I perfer the sliced beef rather than the recipes that say shred.  Took it up to Chicago to my son and it tastes best a day or two after making.  Mary in TN
607820,95534,2008-09-24,5,This recipe is so good.  My husband has eaten it two nights straight.  Made it as written minus the tabasco.  I highly recommend this recipe to all.
1069763,95534,2008-12-11,5,"Awesome stuff!! I grew up in Chicago and moved 20 some years ago to Memphis Tn. My wife and I try to go back to visit atleast once a year and all we eat while there is italian beef, Chicago dogs, pizza and gyros possible.
Earlier this year we wanted italian beefs more than once a year and since Chicago is 500 miles away we decided to research recipes on online. After looking at all we could find, this one seemed to fit the bill. So I ran out and bought a meat slicer (small investment) which really is the only way to get the beef sliced thinly enough and made out first beefs at home. WOW! this recipes is spot on! Exactly like the beefs we love in Chicago! We took the advice of others and use canned broth instead of the boulion cubes cubes and always make extra so we can ""dunk"" em. I like em with the peppers so we take green bell peppers sliced in approx. 3/4"" strips and put em in a small pan with about an inch of water, cover and boil until they soften and change to a darker green color. Add a few pepper slices to the top of the sandwich and shredded cheddar and hold on to your hat!  We make beefs atleast once a month now and I don't think I'll ever get tired of it.    Thanks!!"
1112596,95534,2009-01-04,5,This recipe is AWESOME!!!  I made it for family Christmas and 9.5# was eaten - toasted buns in the oven and melted provolone cheese on them... added the beef (and some juice) topped with gardineria - out of this world.  It will be made again and again...
355637,95534,2009-03-29,4,"Definitely double the broth, it is SO good. I did cook the meat as directed, and it still came out a bit overcooked! But it was still very tasty."
221099,95534,2009-04-23,4,It was very good but not my favorite recipe for italian beef.
577379,95534,2009-05-11,5,"This was ""Da Bomb!""  I used a 2.5 lb rump roast, but made the amount of gravy listed in the recipe.  I cooked the roast for 60 minutes, took it out and let it rest for 20 minutes while I made Da gravy.  The next day (after marinating), I put everything in the crockpot to reheat.  Served on toasted ciabatta rolls with grilled onions and melted provolone cheese.  YUM!  Great recipe!!!!"
1282085,95534,2009-05-30,5,"Hello to all,
Let me first say I was born and raised in Chi Town. I just finished this dish and it is now maranating. I have (of coarse sampled it) and I must say it's authentic Chicago Style Beef. As good as I have tasted. The only things I could add is if you can get access to a meat slicer it will make your life way easier. I grew up on the paper thin sliced beef sandwiches and its really hard to slice a roast into paper thin slices without a machine. Also I would use a processor to mince the garlic. I think the randomness of the hand mincing leaves too many big chunks. Lastly... If you make this then you need to double the gravey or jus. In true Chicago style I love beef sandwiches wet, not dry. And for the finishing touch a few peperchinis. All in all this recipe captures the true Chicago style Italian beef sandwich. Five stars, AWESOME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1244044,95534,2009-06-30,4,Turned out great.  I think a meat slicer is the way to go to get almost shaved meat.  I'd recommend making a double batch of da gravy.
1185708,95534,2009-12-13,5,"My family and I are from the south side, we all live in San Diego now.  When I made this for them, none of us made it in the past we just ran out a picked up sandwiches whenever we wanted them, to a person they were delighted.  This is the real deal.  I am making my second batch and getting ready for Chargers/Cowgirls later today.  Football and Italian Beef in San Diego an unbeatable combination.  Chef #1282085 is correct double the size of the au jus, you'll be glad you did.  Enjoy!!  Go Chargers!!"
765469,95534,2010-03-12,5,My family loves this recipe!  The biggest challenge is to slice this thinly without a meat slicer.  LOVE it!
681864,95534,2010-05-06,5,"Perfect, my family ate it like it was the only meal they had consumed in awhile....  The only change I made was the double the Da Gravy and add a little more garlic, hubby really likes the garlic taste.  Thanks for the recipe"
1655632,95534,2011-02-19,5,"As you might be able to tell from my name, I'm a big fan of Chicago food and this beef was delicious.  You do need access to a slicer to get the beef sliced good and thin.  If you've got a relationhip with your butcher or deli, maybe they'll slice it for you (especially if you're willing to share some beef).  Double the gravy- you won't regret it if you like to pour it on.  I inserted 12 garlic cloves into my roast before roasting and they sliced up with the beef.  I've made this twice now, and it is the only Italian beef I'll ever make."
1699816,95534,2011-06-06,5,"OK, I'm from NC, never been to Chi, but this was wonderful!  I actually had a london broil on hand which I used, wasn't able to marinate overnight, but this was very, very good.  I'll make it the right way next time, I promise!  Thanks for bringing a taste of the north to the south!"
1938861,95534,2011-06-22,5,This is a family favorite and great for a big crowd because it is made the night before. I would not skimp on the gravy since we dip the roll tops.  Don't pass on the Giardiniera either.
646304,95534,2011-07-11,4,This was surprisingly good.  I didn't think I'd like a soggy sandwich but ages from 3 to 43 we all gobbled it up and agreed we should make more next time.  I think next time we'll try to thicken some of the gravey and serve over rice on the side.
163281,95534,2011-07-12,5,I've made this recipe on 2 seperate occassion and it was excellent.  No fuss no muss great sandwich meat.  Thanks!
1974901,95534,2011-08-03,0,I grew up in Chicago...I LOVE this recipe and have made this recipe so many times. I double the gravy recipe. Went and invested in a meat slicer because this is such a good recipe!
1522598,95534,2011-12-31,5,"Being from the South Side, I've tasted a lot of Italian Beef.  This one is the best one I've come across.  ""Rival"" makes a good quality, cheap meat slicer, which is ESSENTIAL for Italian Beef to get it really thin. Gotta double up on ""Da Gravy""!!"
795020,95534,2012-03-14,5,"This recipe is da bomb! As one who spent most of his life just outside Chicago, Italian (Eye-talian) beef is (was) a staple. And when I moved west a few years ago, I assumed that it was as ubiquitous as hamburgers and hot dogs. Not!! I looked high and low, but--sadly--this delicious sandwich was nowhere to be found. (I've since come across a couple Chicago-themed places that serve it, but I have to drive 60 mi. and plunk down almost $9 for a sandwich!) I've tried making it at home a few times with, at best, average results. And the last time I made it I had to try slicing it with a knife. The flavor was good, but you just can't get it right (i.e., thin enough) with a knife. And I just couldn't justify splurging for a slicer. But I was happy to stumble across one recently at a thrift store in like-new condition for only $12. Italian beef was coming to our table very soon!! And so I tried this recipe and, with some good, not-too-crusty/tough, French bread, you'd swear you're eating carryout from your favorite IB joint. Even my teenaged daughter, who doesn't usually care much for beef, went back for seconds! My tips for the recipe are to at least triple ""da gravy,"" and next time I'll probably quadruple it. You want your cooked and sliced beef completely submerged to absorb all the yummy goodness. But I would only double the garlic and Worcestershire; 2x on those two ingredients is plenty. And even at double it is plenty garlicky. But it's oh so delicious. SIX STARS!!"
65056,64045,2004-11-10,5,"Ohhhh, I could eat this til I explode!  It is so so so SO yummy!  I follwed the recipe exactly with 2 exceptions- I subbed the sambal with about 1/2 tsp Zhoug  #57689 (I don't know why but I've never gotten around to ever buying any sambal oelek) and used 2/3 cup canned tomatoes rather than fresh (not in season now in November).  I made it in my new wok as suggested, which is good because this makes a lot and I don't know if it would have fit in my large pan as well as it did in the wok.  This is my first experience with tempeh and I must say that I love it!  I was worried when I added the broth that it would be too much, because it was really liquidy, but as it simmered a lot of it evaporated off, leaving you with a nice bit of sauce.  We served this over brown rice and it made such an excellent dinner.  Lots of crisp and flavorful veggies with chunks of dense and meaty tempeh and the rich peanut/coconut topping- awesome! I think that the peanut/coconut may have really made the dish- I love the flavor they added and the extra richness.  This was pretty easy to throw together once all the chopping is out of the way (I enlisted BF as a sous chef, so it was a piece of cake for me!)  The sauce is very yummy- in regard to the spicy stuff, I added 1 thai red pepper, 1/4 tsp cayenne and the zhoug as I mentioned and we found it just hot enough for our tastes!  The tomato flavor is not strong, so this doesn't taste like Italian food or anyting.  SO GOOD, JUST SO GOOD!!!  I wish I had found this in time for Ready Set Cook, but I'm glad that I chose this for Pick Your Chef Nov. '04.  It has just blown me out of the water with how wonderful this is!"
382364,64045,2007-09-13,5,"This was SO yummy. I really enjoyed the entire dish but the real reason this recipe is getting five stars is for the AMAZING marinade!  I've used it three or four times since Tuesday.  I absolutely LOVE it.  It absorbs beautifully in Seitan, I used it on tofu...WOW!  thanks so much Pets'R'us for a WONDERFUL soy marinade.  It will spend many happy years in my kitchen!"
27678,64045,2009-11-10,5,This was the first time we tried tempeh and we really enjoyed the texture of it. The sauce that goes on the tempeh when you're frying it makes all the difference to the dish. We had this without peanuts and coconut on top (none in the house) but I'm sure that would be a fine addition.
424680,343338,2009-04-26,5,"Here's A REALLY GREAT TASTING SOUP, & one that I'll be happy to make over & over in the future! I pretty much followed the recipe although I did substitute lemon pepper for the usual S&P, & the cloves of garlic that I used were LARGE! I also used some homemade vegetable broth here & some home-grown rosemary (the only one in my very, very small garden)! I also enjoy the subtle flavor that leeks give to a recipe like this! Thanks for sharing it! [Tagged, made & reviewed (however late I was!) for one of my Vegan groupmates in the Vegetarian/Vegan Recipe Swap #8]"
1522315,343338,2011-05-31,4,"4 stars because it's tasty, super easy, super fast, vegan, healthy, and soup.  All my favorite things!  Featured it on my blog. http://crashtestvegetarian.com/?p=1736"
1109280,343338,2011-12-30,4,YUMMY!!!!  My non vegan family loved the soup!  I followed the directions and it turned out great!  I did have to make it in two pots which in the end turned out best.  The only  thing I would do differently would be not to puree the potatoes but somehow only puree the leeks.  This is only because of the color of the finished soup (due to picky eaters they may hesitate about the questionable color then the unpureed leeks.)If your vege broth is not brown then you may have no problems with the color.  So easy and will make again!
2001182977,343338,2016-09-25,5,"I'm always a fan of recipe with few ingredients for tight-budget-weeks. This recipe turned out great, with a few modifications: I only used 2 leeks and I didn't blend this. Just used a fork to mash the potatoes near the end (I let the soup simmer for closer to 35 minutes to soften up the potatoes further.) If you can afford more leeks, definitely use them! I wish I'd added more rosemary, too. I did not add more broth at the end, and my soup was more of a mashed potato consistency, which I liked a lot. The flavor developed very nicely over the week I ate this. This yielded 4 hearty meals for me over 1 week."
311003,211833,2008-01-28,5,"Wow, what a delicious meal this makes. The pork was very tender, and even though apples are often included in pork recipes, I'd never used them before when cooking with pork. I didn't know what I was missing! The only thing I did differently was to use regular long-grain rice instead of Minute Rice. I made it first, and then after cooking the other ingredients, I just put a little broth in the pan and laid the cooked rice on top of the pork chops, without mixing it in, so it would stay warm, but not get mushy while the the ingredients simmered for 10 minutes. This is my new favorite pork recipe, one that I'll be making over and over again. Thanks, Lainey for a terrific recipe!!"
242766,83062,2007-01-01,5,"Delicious!!  This bread is very moist and flavorful. I halved the recipe and made 1 loaf. I used the larger amount of spices and it turned out perfect. With all of the spices in this recipe, the flavor is similar to banana gingerbread. I added a small amount of banana extract to boost the banana flavor. This is something I always do when I make banana bread. I baked the bread in a cast iron loaf pan for 1 hour at 325 degrees. My family loved this wonderful, different banana bread. Thank you for sharing."
313014,83062,2007-09-09,5,"Very good! Moist and delicious.  I didn't have walnuts or pecans, so I used a combination of sliced almonds and chopped peanuts."
